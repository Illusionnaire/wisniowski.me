  "content":"The Last Few Weeks I’ve decided to do something slightly different with this entry. Today is July 8th, 2024 and I am currently sitting in an airport waiting for my first flight to Sydney from Melbourne. I am flying out for a non production build trip with our Australian customer New South Wales and hope to have a productive three and a half days in their offices setting up Epic for the first time for them. Given I have an hour and a half flight ahead of me, I’ll hand write this entry and upload the photos of the pages. Hopefully my handwriting is legible.\nTranscribed from notes in my notebook: I’ve realized a while ago that it was inevitable for me to eventually fall back into old habits and leisurely activities that I was used to back living alone in Wisconsin. There is only so much hiking and walking and exploring that one person can handle without feeling like it is an extra job to be enjoying your hobbies. A few weeks ago I went on two hikes back to back days … one on Saturday and one on Sunday. In reality, I was committing all of my time to those hiking days. As I was cat-sitting for a coworker at the same time, I was waking up at 4:00 AM to have time to walk to their apartment and feed the cat, so that I could then take a bus/tram/train to a separate location to meet up to hike at 7:00 AM. Then, following the hikes I would have to do the same walk back to feed the cat and get back home. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for previously cooking dinner and preparing sandwiches for lunch, I would have likely been too tired to eat dinner those days.\nWith that being said, my last few weeks were filed with watching movies, shows, and playing some video games that I’ve had on my backlog. In the last three weeks I’ve put a sizable dent in some shows that were on my watchlist. I finished and thoroughly enjoyed the ending to Dark Matter\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; playing on Apple TV+. I am watching “Presumed Innocent” as it releases each Wednesday. I am almost done with “The Pacific” which had an episode take place in Melbourne, which was a pleasant surprise. I watched “The Fall of the House of Usher” while doing things like filling out the paperwork for my passport renewal forms, comparing my finances, and doing dishes and laundry. I also watched “Inside Out 2”.\nLast week, I was finally reimbursed for some of the moving expenses I incurred during my relocation and so I took the chance to fill my emergency fund back up to close to where it was before. Almost everything was reimbursed that I logged, with only my computer purchase outstanding. It seems that Epic won’t pay for that, so I am happy that I was around net-even from the sale of my US computer to fund the purchase of the one here in Australia.\naside: Even on an hour and a half long flight, Qantas airlines provided pumpkin and carrot fritters that are warm and a great treat, especially for a 7:00 AM flight. I doubt any airline in the US would do that for a short domestic flight\nWith interest rates for my high yield savings account through Apple Savings at 4.4% and me maxing out my 401K and Roth IRA contributions every year since joining Epic, I am very happy with where I am financially. With the way I usually spend, I find myself in a situation where I want to make the most of my time out here with memorable trips. Currently, I’m really interested in trying to do some international hiking trips, with the only thing stopping me is the lack of confidence I have in my skills in multi-day trekking and the uncertainty of what I will do with my vacation days, but I realized as I looked more closely into it that the second one isn’t as much of a problem as I thought it was before, as after two years at Epic your vacation days accumulation rate increases to 1.25 days/month. Planning around weekends and quite a few trips can be done with my vacation rate at this point.\nTherefore, I want to get it in writing, but my current goals are to rent out a car and do two weekend day trips. One, to Philip Island and the nearby George Bass Coastal Walk. Two, for an overnight camping trip to Wilson’s Prom. I am giving myself until the end of August to do both. To do so I’ll need to figure out rental cars here in Australia and also buy some hiking gear like a tent, sleeping bag, and learn the logistics of food and water for a longer stay out in the wild.\nBeyond TV shows and movies, I also got back into video games that I haven’t played for a while because of the move. Back in February, I bought myself a bunch of singe player games that were story-rich. It took over a month, but I found the time to beat Final Fantasy VII Remake, and it’s prequel Crisis Core. Now I can’t wait for the PS5 exclusion Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth to release on the PC. I also got back in touch with friends from New Jersey and had a really long and fun gaming session playing a puzzle game called “Lorelei and the Laser Eyes” and we got o hoked that we beat the 15 hour game in two sessions and I may or may not have slept for one of those nights ;). I’m looking forward to continue to play through my backlog, with Hades as the next one on the list. The Alters also looks promising from it’s demo, which I played and recorded to put onto my youtube channel:\nFinally, our team here in Mebourne had our annual Epic Picnic “EpicNic” which we rebranded as “EpicVic” here in Australia as we are in the Victoria territory here. I included some pictures that I took, but it was more hectic than I would have liked. We were out in the Melbourne Zoo, and we had an event to go and find hidden clues around different paths around the zoo enclosures, but it ended up being that we were rushing through the locations instead of enjoying the animals. After the event was over I took some extra time to check out the Australia specific enclosures. If you had not heard of it before, I recommend you google what a cassowary is, as it was a very unique bird that I was able to see in its habitat that I didn’t know existed until that day. With that, I found that I’ve been writing for over an hour and we are about to land. Thank you for keeping me company throughout this flight.\nImages and Videos Link here\nFun Songs "},{

  "content":"The Last Few Weeks It’s been a while since I last wrote one of these because the last few weeks have been busy with work and weekends of hiking. I’ve enjoyed walking around, especially at night to see the nooks and crannies of Melbourne. There’s a lot of hidden art around the neighborhood and the alleyways are always calling me to take the scenic route back when walking.\nEarlier in June I went and had some lunch and met with some local hires from Australia who made it back from the States to Melbourne after their training. I also spent a weekend cat sitting for a coworker and walked back and forth from my apartment to theirs for an hour. That same weekend was full of walking as I also spent time going on hikes out in the Werribee Gorge and the Cathedral Ranges. So far, these two hikes have been my favorite so far. The Gorge walk was with large scaled walls on both sides and more visual than some of the other hikes and walks that were done.\nI’ve definitely cemented that I want to find my way over to Tasmania to do some multi-day hikes because I find that I’ve been enjoying this type of lifestyle of non-stop walking and exploration. Even when I’m soaked and walking for multiple hours, I’m always smiling from ear to ear, so I want to pursue this hobby and interest even further and spend some more money towards it.\nAt the end of April I also got my Australian driver’s license and was put on a P2 (Probationary 2) driver’s license up until July 26th 2025, so I want to do as much as I can without a car until that date and then try some longer drives in both Australia and New Zealand after that date.\nImages and Videos Link here\nFun Songs "},{

  "content":"The Last Few Weeks I spent a lot of my time this week focused on work and trying to get in some good outdoor nature hikes and walks from the area. With Brian back in the office following his time in the US for XGM, Singapore has not calmed down with the amount of work that they require devoted to them. I find that there’s something extremely difficult with working on a customer that they themselves feel overwhelmed while also being generally new. Sometimes there’s a need to devote additional time to topics that make a good foundation of knowledge for their jobs, but then you realize you don’t have the time to be able to do it as you’re off solving another problem that pops up an hour later. I will say, that Singapore and I expect New South Wales will both keep me honest about whether I can actually explain the core concepts and how things in our Epic system interact with each other. Brian brings a lot of the technical knowledge that 10+ years of working has provided him, but I think I can help keep Brian and the ODBAs organized and aligned. I am a bit scared with how things will work once New South Wales work starts ramping up, but I am just hoping that we can get through some of the backlog that the RHEL8 migration brought with it.\nThe interesting thing about working with the customers out here in Australia, is there seem to be a lot of plans for expansion of the system, unless I just came at the time that a lot of our hardware configuration and parallel capacity assessment refreshes were happening. Each of the customers may be moving towards a future in the next two years where we need to buy new hardware. Specifically, Singapore and New South Wales are on a trajectory to being two of the biggest customers we have, and so I want to make myself a strong leader to my ODBAs and customer counterparts with making things feel like they are planned and completed in a smooth way, versus the more hectic approach that has been happening so far.\nIn a typical week so far, I have been averaging around 25 hours (consistently) devoted to working with Singapore.\nBeyond work, I have been forcing myself to be more of a self-sustaining adult. I have been cooking and bringing my own lunch to work every day, and while it feels like a lot of my time has been just staying up with cooking and cleaning and laundry and writing these journals, I think that they are all good habits to build. I wrote in the last entry that I was looking to meet with the Melbourne Bushwalking group, but I never found the time in the last two weeks to go downtown after work and meet with them. Instead, I met a group that meets and hikes every weekend and I ended up doing a 24km day of hiking with them recently. I took a few pictures and videos I uploaded to youtube above from the experience. It was also the first time I talked with some locals and they had some good interesting stories. One of the guys I met works for a smaller company that deals with geospatial data and worked on the map that you can get from scanning the QR codes at the local zoo. He also recommended I watch The Castle, as it’s a comedy set in Melbourne. I’m planning to try to get a movie night set up with some coworkers to do so. I also walked to the nearby Yarra River and took a pit stop at an ikea to buy some small house stuff like a mat for the bathroom.\nIn the last two weeks I’ve also spent some time watching some new shows and movies as well as playing a few games on my computer. I finished watching Sugar and thought it was just alright. The Fallout show was also enjoyable, but didn’t catch my intrigue as much as it might have someone who had played the games. It was definitely fun, but wasn’t as thought provoking or different than a lot of the things put out. I did really enjoy two shows throughout this week though. Ripley, released on Apple TV+ was a very interesting noir old-school Italian atmosphere around someone who commits identity theft and I think visually and story wise it grasped my attention quite well. I’ve also been enjoying Dark Matter on Apple TV+ which has scratched my itch of the type of overthinking mind-bending shows that I always like to ponder. If you like Inception, Dark, or Interstellar, you’d probably like Dark Matter. Finally, I also watched the 2024 released movie Civil War, which was an interesting take on the subject. I didn’t expect the movie to follow a photographer through a make-believe rendition of a civil war, but it at least kept my attention while I cooked and cleaned one evening.\nI had also found out these last two weeks that my favorite musical artist released an album that I missed while preparing for the trip to Australia and so I enjoyed listening to Finest on loop throughout this week.\nThis upcoming weekend I’m going to be going to Lerderdeng Gorge for a hike with someone that reached out on Facebook. On Sunday I’ll try to go to a museum as I haven’t been yet, and I’m also going to head to a coworkers place as I’ve agreed to cat sit for them over the long King’s weekend on June 8th. I’ll probably read a bit more of my book with some of that downtime of traveling. I have a few books on my backlog, including wanting to read the book that Dark Matter was based on as it seems very intriguing.\nI’m also going to make some commitments for long term Australia plans here in writing so I can see whether I can stick to them. I want to travel out to New Zealand for a few days. I want to meet one of my old coworkers when I interned there back in 2019 and then also go and do a few things I didn’t have a chance to do before due to money or time. I want to get comfortable with overnight hiking and I want to plan to do one or two long term treks in Tasmania. I think I can have a great time by committing ~$2k for the equipment and then the plane ticket and accommodation. I want to explore Singapore in October when I go out for a DR cutover event with my customers. I want to try to maybe tack on some vacation time afterwards to see some of Vietnam/Thailand/Indonesia, but I don’t know how plausible that is as I expect there will be issues following the event that we will be trying to solve the following week. I want to get comfortable with renting out a car in Australia and doing some longer weekend drives. Sometimes I feel like I may enjoy just driving and seeing the countryside without having a specific destination in mind, but I can likely find some great destinations and make some fun road trips.

  "content":"Introduction Compared to my first two weeks in Australia, the last two weeks have been a lot calmer. I decided to take it slow this week as I’ve been backing up one of my colleagues\u0026rsquo; customers as they flew out for Epic’s XGM conference back in Wisconsin and so I was the front-line Server Systems person available for three customers for the last week and a few days the week before. I got myself accustomed to going to the grocery store after work before arriving back home to make it an easier walk and I had another big day of cleaning as a few kitchen supplies came in to help me with meal-prepping.\nWeekend Activities Saturday, April 27th was quite an eventful day as it started with me having to go downtime to pick up a keyboard for my newly bought computer. The girl I bought it from lived downtime in the QV Melbourne which was this big shopping center where I guess the third and fourth floors were reserved for actual residents. There was a food court on the ground floor, some shops for the next two floors and then elevator access to things like laundry and gyms and the apartments themselves. It was a nice atmosphere, but I very much expect the prices to be absurd to rent over there. Afterwards, I decided to take a walk down to the river and the royal botanical gardens, which were quite pleasant as it was a nice sunny and warm day. On my way back home, I passed near the sports centers and actually ended up near the arena at the time people were rushing in to get to a game. Huge crowds and everyone wearing their teams colors. Australians take their sports seriously it seems.\nOn Sunday, I took a walk to explore one of the smaller libraries near my apartment, but didn’t find anything I liked. It was a small and quiet building, but I’ll likely try to find some time to head down to the big popular one downtown on an upcoming weekend.\nI’ve started watching a few shows recently now that my computer and TV are set up how I’m used to. I’ve really enjoyed the release of “Dark Matter” on Apple TV and it’s two episodes so far. I was also able to finish watching “Barry” during the weekdays and kept up to date with “X-men ‘97” and “Sugar” which have been releasing on Thursdays.\nSaturday, May 11th, I met up with some coworkers and took a bus down to St. Kilda to play volleyball on the beach. It was a very nice atmosphere and yet another warm and sunny day. I know that my legs will be aching for a while from all the tournament games we played, but it turns out that the season just ended and they hosted this one off event on a Saturday because the weather was nice. I will definitely be joining when the season restarts later in October.\nI had been looking to find good ways to meet some locals and did some research online for a few things I was interested in going to, but didn’t have a chance to these last two weeks as I stayed at work a bit later than I needed to in order to make those timings. The one I am most interested in is a bushwalking club that meets downtown and goes out to some hikes and trails around the Melbourne area. They all pitch together to get cars or buses to the start and end of the trails and make a half-day event out of them on Sundays. Seems fun and I’m hoping to introduce myself on Wednesday!\nhttps://mbw.org.au/mbw_index.php\nI also plan to consolidate grocery expenses out here into a spreadsheet for myself to compare with how much things cost back home. It’s been really hard to ground myself with prices for food as there’s a conversion for AUD to USD, but also a unit conversion of lbs to kg or to 100g as a baseline. I don’t think I’ve yet overpaid absurdly for any groceries, but there are some things that I just don’t know if they’re much more expensive than in the US at this point, or if the prices are generally comparable.\nImages and Videos Link here\n"},{

  "content":"When I was moving out of my apartment in Wisconsin, I realized how helpful and important it was to look back at the prices that I purchased things and to help wrap my head around how much money it will take to move to a new apartment and furnish it all from the beginning. I expect this will be a good exercise for me to organize a bunch of my own purchases to try to get some things reimbursed from the trip, but the following is all the money I have spent alongside the move. Maybe I can optimize this next time around! This does not include recurring expenses like food or transportation that needed to be purchased irrelevant of a move.\nThe money I re-couped from my move:\nSold my TV for $150 Sold my couch and some end tables for $250 Sold exercise bench and dumbbells for $120 Sold my computer for $700 Kept some furniture and moved it back to New Jersey, so there are less things to purchase on the way back. Total = $1,220 USD The money I spent alongside the move:\n$500 US to move furniture back to New Jersey w/ help of uncle from Wisconsin $78 for gas to drive bag to New Jersey from Wisconsin (1,000 mile trip) $1044.95 for one month of rent at my old apartment that I wasn’t staying at before my lease expired $150 for apartment cleaning fee (even though they said I left it spotless, probably some steaming service for the carpet boo… 🙁) $100 for one extra baggage back at the airport $820 for a hotel for 7 days ($1,278.90 AUD) $15.44 for bus from airport to hotel ($23.90 AUD) $32.59 for miscellaneous kitchen items (trip 1) ($50.60 AUD) $54.30 for cleaning supplies, miscellaneous kitchen and bathroom items ($84.62 AUD) $269.24 for couch from Facebook Marketplace ($420 AUD) $716.39 for a computer and monitors. I think this one is better than the one I had in the US. ($1100 AUD) $19.25 for a wireless keyboard, a wired keyboard, and a wireless mouse from Facebook marketplace ($30 AUD). $261.31 for a Sony 55” TV ($400 AUD) $224.58 for two tables, three chairs, a vacuum, some starter kitchen supplies, an area rug, two lamps, and some other miscellaneous items ($350 AUD). $135.71 for bedding, pillows and duvet insert ($210 AUD) $254.63 for bed frame and mattress ($394 AUD) $35.90 for random foreign transaction fees at ATMs and online purchases before I had my Australian bank account set up $13.43 to schedule appointment to transfer drivers license to Australian one ($20 AUD) $85.66 for a Dualshock 5 controller and large mousepad ($128 AUD) $76.20 for a Fujitora Chef’s Knife ($86.90 AUD) $44.35 for a drying rack for laundry ($66.19 AUD) $92.77 for miscellaneous tools and deli containers/utensils ($138.47 AUD) Total: $5,024.70 Still Expecting:\n$130 for renewing my passport before the end of this year ($208 AUD) Not priced in since it likely swaps with things I was paying for in the US:\nHot Water and Gas came out to ~$90.00 in the first month Internet (25/10 Mbps aka 3MB/s) for $74.00 $25.53 for Optus telecom provider (25 GB of data a month, cheapest plan.

  "content":"Introduction Back in my sophomore year of college, I had the opportunity to go to Chengdu, China on an internship program. During my time there, I had a job, but was also taking some classes for credit and one of the classes stressed the value of writing a weekly journal during my time abroad as a way to process and put into words the new experiences I was going through at the time. I personally think that one of the most important things you can do in your life is learn from your past experiences and find the things that you enjoy. There’s been plenty of times that I have gone for walks around town back in Wisconsin and New Jersey where I would take a picture of a house and jot down a reason why I liked a certain part of it or a new perspective on how things are run in different countries. I want to be able to write a journal for my thoughts, not just to keep people in the loop back home about how things are going out in Australia, but also as a way for me to remember the adventures and struggles of this part in my life twenty or more years down the road. I want to write about the ways I have done things, things that I like and don’t like, and getting into the weeds of things like finances and planning trips to go see different places and just move my thoughts from my brain to a digital media. I also want to share pictures! Now, with the introduction out of the way, here’s a few thoughts on the first few weeks before and arriving in Australia.\nI plan to write one of these every two weeks or so, as I think that’s more sustainable for the long run of three years.\nGetting Things Ready Through most of March and April (and honestly ever since like January) I spent a lot of time getting things ready for getting out of my apartment in Wisconsin, getting all my bills and services canceled, and getting furniture sold. It felt a bit disappointing that there were things that I had spent two years getting to make my space my own having to be sold for usually less than I paid for. Still, I think I enjoy decorating my living space as the constraints of the floorplan and furniture lets my mind think of all these cool different configurations for where to place things and how to make a space uniquely mine that I was looking forward to seeing what I could do with my space in Australia. I also spent some time exploring a few other places I hadn’t been yet in Wisconsin. I wanted to go see Taliesin and House on the Rock, but unfortunately those places were closed until around mid-April. Ultimately, I think I did good in the things I sold off (a couch to a girl that was moving into a new apartment on the east side of town, and some exercise equipment to a mother with some rowdy boys probably going to college soon) but I very much appreciate one of my uncles back from Connecticut who was used to doing long haul drives making his way over with a trailer attachment and helping me load things back to New Jersey. On April 5th, I got a phone call early on my drive to work that my uncle was going to be entering Wisconsin at around noon, so I pivoted to taking a half and half day and made time for some goodbyes around the office. I was also lucky enough to have lunch with one of my ODBAs, Meenoi, who was at the campus for some training so we spent some time chatting. I left work around 1 PM and drove back home and started to pack a few items into the back of my car before my uncle arrived and we put the larger furniture items into his. It was a lot of work, but we got everything ready for the drive by around 5-6 PM.\nThe Drive Afterwards, I had a 17 hour drive ahead of me back to New Jersey. Previously in the week, I was messing around with Cruise Control around some highways and parking lots to get comfortable with my car’s use of it. I had only ever driven 3 hours straight for a trip out to Door County back in September, so I wasn’t really aware how I would feel. My uncle and I parted ways and took our own pace to get back to New Jersey. My first stop was to fill up at a gas station and to buy myself a Monster Energy drink for the road, as my coworker Elisha mentioned that it was what I needed for the long road ahead. I noticed an “Aussie Lemonade” flavor which felt like destiny so I went with that. Then, I got onto the BeltLine highway and was greeted with the absolute worst traffic I’ve experienced in Wisconsin throughout all my time there. Supposedly there was a pretty big accident and so I spent more time getting out of Madison than afterwards taking the highway from Madison to Milwaukee. Lovely. The rest of the drive was pretty smooth sailing. I cooked some kielbasa and cut it up into slices and ate it like beef jerky throughout my drive, and was able to get through Chicago and a part of Illinois without taking a break. I took my first 30 minute break or so in Portage. I kept driving through Indiana, Ohio and the western part of Pennsylvania throughout the night, taking a stop here or there to fill up gas and/or stretch my legs and I cracked my Monster Energy drink around midnight and had a pretty great stretch of driving from midnight to around 4:30 AM where there were no cars and good tunes. Around 4 AM I thought to drive by a rest stop to try and get some sleep as I started to feel the effects of not being able to focus on the road. It wasn’t too bad, but I knew it would probably get worse. Unfortunately, while I had a pillow and blanket ready and the rest area was pretty good, I wasn’t able to get too much sleep. I closed my eyes for a while, but woke up and realized only 40 minutes had passed, and just knew this wasn’t going to work. Some louder trucks were nearby and I just couldn’t get comfortable. Around 6, I started driving again to finish the final stretch through Pennsylvania and it wasn’t the best until like 9 AM. It got a lot better after I stopped by a McDonalds and got a coffee and some breakfast, but I don’t care to remember those hours. I arrived back in New Jersey around noon and got home around 1 PM on Saturday April 6th after around 1,000 miles of driving. I enjoyed a few days with hometown friends and family and did some final work before my flight out on April 11th (Thursday of the following week).\nOverall, with less than a year of driving under my belt, I feel like I could make my way anywhere at this point, which I personally think was a big accomplishment for me. Maybe I will drive out to Mt. Rushmore next time I’m out in Wisconsin, haha.\nOther I also included some videos of a real estate agent out in Melbourne doing inspections of some properties. I didn’t get the first one I applied for, but paid slightly extra for the second one to make sure I, for sure, had a place to live once my hotel ended. It was priced at $560 AUD a week, or around $1,750 USD a month. I was paying $1,050 a month in Wisconsin for a bigger place, but I guess I won’t be paying transportation costs and will be able to walk to the grocery store, work, and train stations for when I want to travel a bit further.\nImages and Videos Link here\n"},{

  "content":"I left for the airport on April 11th to leave the US and start the next big adventure of my life. I still don’t think I’ll ever understand how much time I need at Newark. Some days, like today, I was able to get through customs in around 30 minutes. Other times, I need over an hour and there’s no rhyme or reason to understanding what kind of day it will be. I downloaded a few TV shows and movies and got a few books ready on my phone for the journey. Dune Two was alright, but I didn’t fully get the hype. I would say it was slightly better than Dune One, but it’s mainly a story about the world and politics of the world, instead of the characters that inhabit it, which I more often prefer. Kung Fu Panda 4 was passable, but nothing special. I was also planning to watch Pan’s Labyrinth, but I got a Spanish version so I quickly went away from that one. With a 6 hour layover in San Francisco, I spent some time listening to some music and just waiting for the time to pass. I read a bunch of “Wiser, Richer, Happier” by William Green and enjoyed the break out of each chapter being about a different person so I could put it down and find something else when I wasn’t feeling it. I had a middle seat on the 15 hour flight to Australia and I got some sleep in, but I tried to convert it over to Australian time for when I should be sleeping.\nThe first week went by pretty fast. After landing, on the first day I walked around a bit to get used to the city. I lugged my two large suitcases, one carry-on suitcase and one backpack 30 minutes or so to the hotel. I probably should have figured out a bus or something, but I’m a cheapskate and didn’t want to deal with figuring it out. The hotel room was like a full apartment, with a full kitchen and living room for around the price you would get a US hotel for, so if these compare to others in Australia, hotels are probably better value here. The rest of the first day was spent going to a grocery store to get a few items for lunch and dinner, and then getting my phone set up with Optus. I also took a walk to see my new apartment complex in person, met the building manager and made sure that nothing was missed in terms of paperwork or planning while I was still in the US. I tried to set up my bank as well, but it was closed over the weekend.\nDay two, I made a larger grocery store trip to an Aldi that wasn’t too far away, but was going to be the one I was using long term as it was close to my work and I also checked out our office lobby and surrounding area. I spent a lot of the rest of the day searching on Facebook marketplace for furniture and ordering a mattress and bed frame for when I would eventually get my apartment on Friday that following week. I walked around to some other areas around the city as well. I personally enjoy opening up my google maps app and finding a green area, be it a park or bike trail or section near a river and just finding my way over there, so I did something similar and explored a few parks as well as some other places where I was possibly looking to get an apartment at to just explore parts of the city.\nOn Monday, I woke up at 4 AM due to jet lag and made some lunch for work early that morning. On my way to work I saw a hot air balloon (I would see more on Friday from my hotel balcony) which felt like a good sign for a great new beginning. It wasn’t a Ho-Oh at the start of Ash’s Pokemon journey, but I’ll take what I can get haha. Work was pretty slow as I was getting myself situated, but a lot of the folks that I spoke to so far weren’t actually in the office that day. My move mentor Houston was out, my team lead Cory was out, and my coworker Brian was out. I decided to take a few hours of out of office time to finish setting up my bank and I also needed to walk over to my apartment because for once, Amazon shipping was too fast and I needed to tell them to try to redeliver on Friday as I didn’t have access yet, but the folks doing the deliver where understanding and friendly. After work throughout the week I spent my time scouring Facebook marketplace for more furniture pieces (I was able to find a couch for $420 AUS) and watched some 3 Body Problem on Netflix.\nThe rest of the week flew by as I learned about all the Australian and Singapore customers at work and prepped for my move on Friday. Friday morning I left for work early so I could take my smaller carry-on suitcase and some bags over to pick up my keys. I wasn’t expecting to be woken up by a fire alarm at 1 AM on Friday though, which made the rest of that day really long. Anyway… I was pleasantly surprised that my apartment came with a fridge and washing machine as I wasn’t initially expecting that it would. Between work I also left to help move the couch I purchased into the apartment at around 1 PM that day and some other furniture that was arriving throughout the day. Once work was over, I walked back to my hotel and packed up my other two suitcases and walked them over 30 minutes to the new apartment. My hotel was ending on Saturday morning so I decided it was likely better to walk them over in the evening when there was less traffic than during a Saturday morning. I also spent more time at the apartment that night to open up my mattress-in-a-box to let it inflate and be ready for use the next night. Then I walked back to my apartment and crashed for the night, at around 1 AM.\nSaturday morning I woke up around 7 AM and headed down to the lobby to check out. I spent most of Saturday building my bed from the Amazon packages and cooked a few meals for the weekend. I did inspect the apartment and took pictures for the inspection report that I needed to fill out. Sometime in the afternoon I decided to take another walk this time to the other side of town where I was at to see the Edinburgh Gardens (which is not actually any gardens but just a public park). It was a nice day and a worthy walk. I also found a guy who was selling some plants on Facebook marketplace so I decided to walk over and buy 4 for $30 AUS (or $20 USD), and it made my apartment feel a bit more homey. That night I was also able to find a lady on Facebook Marketplace who flipped storage lockers by buying them at an auction and then selling what they held for a profit, and she had some desks for sale. A big plus was she was fine with delivering, even though she lived an hour away, because she did this pretty much for a living. We went back and forth a bit and I decided it made more sense for me to take a trip out to her by train to see what other things I might be interested in to get a big bulk buy. We landed on me arriving at 4 PM on Sunday because she had some other deliveries to make earlier that day.\nI decided on Sunday that I would make a bigger trip out of my train ride up to South Murang, as I saw that there was a nice park (Plenty Gorge Park) which had kangaroos just hanging out in the wild over there. I cooked some chicken and a salad for lunch and decided to leave around noon for the train ride. I really enjoyed the houses around the area, and it was a lot more suburban than the inner city of Collingwood. After speaking to the lady, I learned that her rent for her entire 4 bedroom house there was the same as my one bedroom apartment ($560 AUS a week or $1700 USD a month) which made me get a little bit more hope in the country as a whole because I am definitely over paying for what I am getting here, but you have to deal with the cards you are dealt and I’d rather be walking distance from the place where I work than pay $3 USD each way every day to commute by tram. The train ticket was also $3 USD for a one-hour ride, so I’ll definitely be using it whenever I can to explore the surrounding areas near Melbourne. When I arrived at South Murang, I spent a few hours walking around Plenty Gorge Park and was able to see some kangaroos in person as well as quite a few varieties of what we would deem as exotic birds (colorful parrots, herons, etc.) during my walk. I then met with the lady and got a bunch of kitchen supplies, a broom, a vacuum, an ironing board, some pots for my newly purchased plants, two tables, two comfortable office chairs (that don’t swivel) and one office desk chair that does for $350 AUS (or $230 USD). Quite a good deal if you ask me. The rest of that day I spent cleaning parts of the apartment and the new items I got. Near the end of the day I found someone on Facebook marketplace again that was selling his computer so I walked not too far over to check it out in person and introduce myself. Crazy coincidence that he would be moving out to the States (Long Island, NY) in a month while I just moved here, so we kind of swapped places. He would later help move the computer, along with two monitors on Thursday, which was a national holiday, Anzac Day.\nThe rest of the following week went by without too many interesting things happening. It mainly pertained to me coming in to work, and after work coming back and cleaning more of the items I got. My physical bank card came in the mail earlier that week so I got to use that without having to get hit by foreign transaction fees each time I took money out of the ATM to buy some other cleaning supplies, groceries, and household essentials (toilet paper, cutting board, tea :))\nToday is Saturday morning. I plan to make a trip down to the CBD, aka the downtown part of Melbourne, to pick up a keyboard and mouse that I’m purchasing (again from Facebook Marketplace) and am going to spend some time walking around the Yarra River that flows through the city. There are a few botanical gardens nearby and I think a nice day is ahead of me. I got a new phone before my trip out here and unfortunately location services with google weren’t set correctly to show different trips and paths that I’ve walked around the city, but I’ve corrected that this morning and hope to add some cool maps and routes to future entries. I’ve done that before with my travels around the world and would recommend it if you ever find yourself abroad.\nSome things I’ve noticed as pros and cons around Melbourne throughout my first few weeks here:\nPro: Playgrounds and public spaces look a lot more funded.\nPro: There are plenty of exotic and noisy birds that make walking and just looking around fun.\nPro: A lot more things are open outdoor concepts. Restaurants and buildings are built around opening up to the outdoors and having plenty of outdoor seating areas. Some cafes are literally garages where the garage door is open and then it’s decorated like a living space within.\nCon: The pedestrian crossing sign only shows you when you can cross if you press the button.\nCon: There are a bunch of cafes and lunch spaces, but I’m not fully interested in spending $700 a month on eating out to explore them. I’ll probably just cook more often.\nImages + Videos Images and Videos Link\n"}]
