  "content":"When I was moving out of my apartment in Wisconsin, I realized how helpful and important it was to look back at the prices that I purchased things and to help wrap my head around how much money it will take to move to a new apartment and furnish it all from the beginning. I expect this will be a good exercise for me to organize a bunch of my own purchases to try to get some things reimbursed from the trip, but the following is all the money I have spent alongside the move. Maybe I can optimize this next time around! This does not include recurring expenses like food or transportation that needed to be purchased irrelevant of a move.\nThe money I re-couped from my move:\nSold my TV for $150 Sold my couch and some end tables for $250 Sold exercise bench and dumbbells for $120 Sold my computer for $700 Kept some furniture and moved it back to New Jersey, so there are less things to purchase on the way back. Total = $1,220 USD The money I spent alongside the move:\n$500 US to move furniture back to New Jersey w/ help of uncle from Wisconsin $78 for gas to drive bag to New Jersey from Wisconsin (1,000 mile trip) $1044.95 for one month of rent at my old apartment that I wasn‚Äôt staying at before my lease expired $150 for apartment cleaning fee (even though they said I left it spotless, probably some steaming service for the carpet boo‚Ä¶ üôÅ) $100 for one extra baggage back at the airport $820 for a hotel for 7 days ($1,278.90 AUD) $15.44 for bus from airport to hotel ($23.90 AUD) $32.59 for miscellaneous kitchen items (trip 1) ($50.60 AUD) $54.30 for cleaning supplies, miscellaneous kitchen and bathroom items ($84.62 AUD) $269.24 for couch from Facebook Marketplace ($420 AUD) $716.39 for a computer and monitors. I think this one is better than the one I had in the US. ($1100 AUD) $19.25 for a wireless keyboard, a wired keyboard, and a wireless mouse from Facebook marketplace ($30 AUD). $261.31 for a Sony 55‚Äù TV ($400 AUD) $224.58 for two tables, three chairs, a vacuum, some starter kitchen supplies, an area rug, two lamps, and some other miscellaneous items ($350 AUD). $135.71 for bedding, pillows and duvet insert ($210 AUD) $254.63 for bed frame and mattress ($394 AUD) $35.90 for random foreign transaction fees at ATMs and online purchases before I had my Australian bank account set up $13.43 to schedule appointment to transfer drivers license to Australian one ($20 AUD) $85.66 for a Dualshock 5 controller and large mousepad ($128 AUD) $76.20 for a Fujitora Chef‚Äôs Knife ($86.90 AUD) $44.35 for a drying rack for laundry ($66.19 AUD) $92.77 for miscellaneous tools and deli containers/utensils ($138.47 AUD) Total: $5,024.70 Still Expecting:\n$130 for renewing my passport before the end of this year ($208 AUD) Not priced in since it likely swaps with things I was paying for in the US:\nHot Water and Gas came out to ~$90.00 in the first month Internet (25/10 Mbps aka 3MB/s) for $74.00 $25.53 for Optus telecom provider (25 GB of data a month, cheapest plan. I think the dude at the store gave me 10% off and I didn‚Äôt even ask) "},{

  "content":"Introduction Back in my sophomore year of college, I had the opportunity to go to Chengdu, China on an internship program. During my time there, I had a job, but was also taking some classes for credit and one of the classes stressed the value of writing a weekly journal during my time abroad as a way to process and put into words the new experiences I was going through at the time. I personally think that one of the most important things you can do in your life is learn from your past experiences and find the things that you enjoy. There‚Äôs been plenty of times that I have gone for walks around town back in Wisconsin and New Jersey where I would take a picture of a house and jot down a reason why I liked a certain part of it or a new perspective on how things are run in different countries. I want to be able to write a journal for my thoughts, not just to keep people in the loop back home about how things are going out in Australia, but also as a way for me to remember the adventures and struggles of this part in my life twenty or more years down the road. I want to write about the ways I have done things, things that I like and don‚Äôt like, and getting into the weeds of things like finances and planning trips to go see different places and just move my thoughts from my brain to a digital media. I also want to share pictures! Now, with the introduction out of the way, here‚Äôs a few thoughts on the first few weeks before and arriving in Australia.\nI plan to write one of these every two weeks or so, as I think that‚Äôs more sustainable for the long run of three years.\nGetting Things Ready Through most of March and April (and honestly ever since like January) I spent a lot of time getting things ready for getting out of my apartment in Wisconsin, getting all my bills and services canceled, and getting furniture sold. It felt a bit disappointing that there were things that I had spent two years getting to make my space my own having to be sold for usually less than I paid for. Still, I think I enjoy decorating my living space as the constraints of the floorplan and furniture lets my mind think of all these cool different configurations for where to place things and how to make a space uniquely mine that I was looking forward to seeing what I could do with my space in Australia. I also spent some time exploring a few other places I hadn‚Äôt been yet in Wisconsin. I wanted to go see Taliesin and House on the Rock, but unfortunately those places were closed until around mid-April. Ultimately, I think I did good in the things I sold off (a couch to a girl that was moving into a new apartment on the east side of town, and some exercise equipment to a mother with some rowdy boys probably going to college soon) but I very much appreciate one of my uncles back from Connecticut who was used to doing long haul drives making his way over with a trailer attachment and helping me load things back to New Jersey. On April 5th, I got a phone call early on my drive to work that my uncle was going to be entering Wisconsin at around noon, so I pivoted to taking a half and half day and made time for some goodbyes around the office. I was also lucky enough to have lunch with one of my ODBAs, Meenoi, who was at the campus for some training so we spent some time chatting. I left work around 1 PM and drove back home and started to pack a few items into the back of my car before my uncle arrived and we put the larger furniture items into his. It was a lot of work, but we got everything ready for the drive by around 5-6 PM.\nThe Drive Afterwards, I had a 17 hour drive ahead of me back to New Jersey. Previously in the week, I was messing around with Cruise Control around some highways and parking lots to get comfortable with my car‚Äôs use of it. I had only ever driven 3 hours straight for a trip out to Door County back in September, so I wasn‚Äôt really aware how I would feel. My uncle and I parted ways and took our own pace to get back to New Jersey. My first stop was to fill up at a gas station and to buy myself a Monster Energy drink for the road, as my coworker Elisha mentioned that it was what I needed for the long road ahead. I noticed an ‚ÄúAussie Lemonade‚Äù flavor which felt like destiny so I went with that. Then, I got onto the BeltLine highway and was greeted with the absolute worst traffic I‚Äôve experienced in Wisconsin throughout all my time there. Supposedly there was a pretty big accident and so I spent more time getting out of Madison than afterwards taking the highway from Madison to Milwaukee. Lovely. The rest of the drive was pretty smooth sailing. I cooked some kielbasa and cut it up into slices and ate it like beef jerky throughout my drive, and was able to get through Chicago and a part of Illinois without taking a break. I took my first 30 minute break or so in Portage. I kept driving through Indiana, Ohio and the western part of Pennsylvania throughout the night, taking a stop here or there to fill up gas and/or stretch my legs and I cracked my Monster Energy drink around midnight and had a pretty great stretch of driving from midnight to around 4:30 AM where there were no cars and good tunes. Around 4 AM I thought to drive by a rest stop to try and get some sleep as I started to feel the effects of not being able to focus on the road. It wasn‚Äôt too bad, but I knew it would probably get worse. Unfortunately, while I had a pillow and blanket ready and the rest area was pretty good, I wasn‚Äôt able to get too much sleep. I closed my eyes for a while, but woke up and realized only 40 minutes had passed, and just knew this wasn‚Äôt going to work. Some louder trucks were nearby and I just couldn‚Äôt get comfortable. Around 6, I started driving again to finish the final stretch through Pennsylvania and it wasn‚Äôt the best until like 9 AM. It got a lot better after I stopped by a McDonalds and got a coffee and some breakfast, but I don‚Äôt care to remember those hours. I arrived back in New Jersey around noon and got home around 1 PM on Saturday April 6th after around 1,000 miles of driving. I enjoyed a few days with hometown friends and family and did some final work before my flight out on April 11th (Thursday of the following week).\nOverall, with less than a year of driving under my belt, I feel like I could make my way anywhere at this point, which I personally think was a big accomplishment for me. Maybe I will drive out to Mt. Rushmore next time I‚Äôm out in Wisconsin, haha.\nOther I also included some videos of a real estate agent out in Melbourne doing inspections of some properties. I didn‚Äôt get the first one I applied for, but paid slightly extra for the second one to make sure I, for sure, had a place to live once my hotel ended. It was priced at $560 AUD a week, or around $1,750 USD a month. I was paying $1,050 a month in Wisconsin for a bigger place, but I guess I won‚Äôt be paying transportation costs and will be able to walk to the grocery store, work, and train stations for when I want to travel a bit further.\nImages and Videos Link here\n"},{

  "content":"I left for the airport on April 11th to leave the US and start the next big adventure of my life. I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever understand how much time I need at Newark. Some days, like today, I was able to get through customs in around 30 minutes. Other times, I need over an hour and there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason to understanding what kind of day it will be. I downloaded a few TV shows and movies and got a few books ready on my phone for the journey. Dune Two was alright, but I didn‚Äôt fully get the hype. I would say it was slightly better than Dune One, but it‚Äôs mainly a story about the world and politics of the world, instead of the characters that inhabit it, which I more often prefer. Kung Fu Panda 4 was passable, but nothing special. I was also planning to watch Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth, but I got a Spanish version so I quickly went away from that one. With a 6 hour layover in San Francisco, I spent some time listening to some music and just waiting for the time to pass. I read a bunch of ‚ÄúWiser, Richer, Happier‚Äù by William Green and enjoyed the break out of each chapter being about a different person so I could put it down and find something else when I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. I had a middle seat on the 15 hour flight to Australia and I got some sleep in, but I tried to convert it over to Australian time for when I should be sleeping.\nThe first week went by pretty fast. After landing, on the first day I walked around a bit to get used to the city. I lugged my two large suitcases, one carry-on suitcase and one backpack 30 minutes or so to the hotel. I probably should have figured out a bus or something, but I‚Äôm a cheapskate and didn‚Äôt want to deal with figuring it out. The hotel room was like a full apartment, with a full kitchen and living room for around the price you would get a US hotel for, so if these compare to others in Australia, hotels are probably better value here. The rest of the first day was spent going to a grocery store to get a few items for lunch and dinner, and then getting my phone set up with Optus. I also took a walk to see my new apartment complex in person, met the building manager and made sure that nothing was missed in terms of paperwork or planning while I was still in the US. I tried to set up my bank as well, but it was closed over the weekend.\nDay two, I made a larger grocery store trip to an Aldi that wasn‚Äôt too far away, but was going to be the one I was using long term as it was close to my work and I also checked out our office lobby and surrounding area. I spent a lot of the rest of the day searching on Facebook marketplace for furniture and ordering a mattress and bed frame for when I would eventually get my apartment on Friday that following week. I walked around to some other areas around the city as well. I personally enjoy opening up my google maps app and finding a green area, be it a park or bike trail or section near a river and just finding my way over there, so I did something similar and explored a few parks as well as some other places where I was possibly looking to get an apartment at to just explore parts of the city.\nOn Monday, I woke up at 4 AM due to jet lag and made some lunch for work early that morning. On my way to work I saw a hot air balloon (I would see more on Friday from my hotel balcony) which felt like a good sign for a great new beginning. It wasn‚Äôt a Ho-Oh at the start of Ash‚Äôs Pokemon journey, but I‚Äôll take what I can get haha. Work was pretty slow as I was getting myself situated, but a lot of the folks that I spoke to so far weren‚Äôt actually in the office that day. My move mentor Houston was out, my team lead Cory was out, and my coworker Brian was out. I decided to take a few hours of out of office time to finish setting up my bank and I also needed to walk over to my apartment because for once, Amazon shipping was too fast and I needed to tell them to try to redeliver on Friday as I didn‚Äôt have access yet, but the folks doing the deliver where understanding and friendly. After work throughout the week I spent my time scouring Facebook marketplace for more furniture pieces (I was able to find a couch for $420 AUS) and watched some 3 Body Problem on Netflix.\nThe rest of the week flew by as I learned about all the Australian and Singapore customers at work and prepped for my move on Friday. Friday morning I left for work early so I could take my smaller carry-on suitcase and some bags over to pick up my keys. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be woken up by a fire alarm at 1 AM on Friday though, which made the rest of that day really long. Anyway‚Ä¶ I was pleasantly surprised that my apartment came with a fridge and washing machine as I wasn‚Äôt initially expecting that it would. Between work I also left to help move the couch I purchased into the apartment at around 1 PM that day and some other furniture that was arriving throughout the day. Once work was over, I walked back to my hotel and packed up my other two suitcases and walked them over 30 minutes to the new apartment. My hotel was ending on Saturday morning so I decided it was likely better to walk them over in the evening when there was less traffic than during a Saturday morning. I also spent more time at the apartment that night to open up my mattress-in-a-box to let it inflate and be ready for use the next night. Then I walked back to my apartment and crashed for the night, at around 1 AM.\nSaturday morning I woke up around 7 AM and headed down to the lobby to check out. I spent most of Saturday building my bed from the Amazon packages and cooked a few meals for the weekend. I did inspect the apartment and took pictures for the inspection report that I needed to fill out. Sometime in the afternoon I decided to take another walk this time to the other side of town where I was at to see the Edinburgh Gardens (which is not actually any gardens but just a public park). It was a nice day and a worthy walk. I also found a guy who was selling some plants on Facebook marketplace so I decided to walk over and buy 4 for $30 AUS (or $20 USD), and it made my apartment feel a bit more homey. That night I was also able to find a lady on Facebook Marketplace who flipped storage lockers by buying them at an auction and then selling what they held for a profit, and she had some desks for sale. A big plus was she was fine with delivering, even though she lived an hour away, because she did this pretty much for a living. We went back and forth a bit and I decided it made more sense for me to take a trip out to her by train to see what other things I might be interested in to get a big bulk buy. We landed on me arriving at 4 PM on Sunday because she had some other deliveries to make earlier that day.\nI decided on Sunday that I would make a bigger trip out of my train ride up to South Murang, as I saw that there was a nice park (Plenty Gorge Park) which had kangaroos just hanging out in the wild over there. I cooked some chicken and a salad for lunch and decided to leave around noon for the train ride. I really enjoyed the houses around the area, and it was a lot more suburban than the inner city of Collingwood. After speaking to the lady, I learned that her rent for her entire 4 bedroom house there was the same as my one bedroom apartment ($560 AUS a week or $1700 USD a month) which made me get a little bit more hope in the country as a whole because I am definitely over paying for what I am getting here, but you have to deal with the cards you are dealt and I‚Äôd rather be walking distance from the place where I work than pay $3 USD each way every day to commute by tram. The train ticket was also $3 USD for a one-hour ride, so I‚Äôll definitely be using it whenever I can to explore the surrounding areas near Melbourne. When I arrived at South Murang, I spent a few hours walking around Plenty Gorge Park and was able to see some kangaroos in person as well as quite a few varieties of what we would deem as exotic birds (colorful parrots, herons, etc.) during my walk. I then met with the lady and got a bunch of kitchen supplies, a broom, a vacuum, an ironing board, some pots for my newly purchased plants, two tables, two comfortable office chairs (that don‚Äôt swivel) and one office desk chair that does for $350 AUS (or $230 USD). Quite a good deal if you ask me. The rest of that day I spent cleaning parts of the apartment and the new items I got. Near the end of the day I found someone on Facebook marketplace again that was selling his computer so I walked not too far over to check it out in person and introduce myself. Crazy coincidence that he would be moving out to the States (Long Island, NY) in a month while I just moved here, so we kind of swapped places. He would later help move the computer, along with two monitors on Thursday, which was a national holiday, Anzac Day.\nThe rest of the following week went by without too many interesting things happening. It mainly pertained to me coming in to work, and after work coming back and cleaning more of the items I got. My physical bank card came in the mail earlier that week so I got to use that without having to get hit by foreign transaction fees each time I took money out of the ATM to buy some other cleaning supplies, groceries, and household essentials (toilet paper, cutting board, tea :))\nToday is Saturday morning. I plan to make a trip down to the CBD, aka the downtown part of Melbourne, to pick up a keyboard and mouse that I‚Äôm purchasing (again from Facebook Marketplace) and am going to spend some time walking around the Yarra River that flows through the city. There are a few botanical gardens nearby and I think a nice day is ahead of me. I got a new phone before my trip out here and unfortunately location services with google weren‚Äôt set correctly to show different trips and paths that I‚Äôve walked around the city, but I‚Äôve corrected that this morning and hope to add some cool maps and routes to future entries. I‚Äôve done that before with my travels around the world and would recommend it if you ever find yourself abroad.\nSome things I‚Äôve noticed as pros and cons around Melbourne throughout my first few weeks here:\nPro: Playgrounds and public spaces look a lot more funded.\nPro: There are plenty of exotic and noisy birds that make walking and just looking around fun.\nPro: A lot more things are open outdoor concepts. Restaurants and buildings are built around opening up to the outdoors and having plenty of outdoor seating areas. Some cafes are literally garages where the garage door is open and then it‚Äôs decorated like a living space within.\nCon: The pedestrian crossing sign only shows you when you can cross if you press the button.\nCon: There are a bunch of cafes and lunch spaces, but I‚Äôm not fully interested in spending $700 a month on eating out to explore them. I‚Äôll probably just cook more often.\nImages + Videos Images and Videos Link\n"}]
