  "content":"Two Months Passed Already?! Jeez! It feels like only a couple of days ago I was ready to start writing my next post, and then it turns out that it has been almost two months since I made a blog post here. While not too much exciting happened, looking back at my pictures there was a ton of little weekends here and there, and the more I looked back the more I realized, oh yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s what I did that weekend, and that the other weekend. A weekend here, and a weekend there, and oh look two months have passed! I\u0026rsquo;ve growth a little more content with not staying on the bleeding edge of new releases for video games, books, and tv shows and movies, instead choosing to spend that time with either planning some trips or just putting it to things like cooking, which I have been getting a little better at doing over the weekend ahead of the busy weeks ahead. I personally feel a little sad about just not being in the mental state after coming home from work to make progress in the video games that I am fully interested in playing from a story aspect, but just don\u0026rsquo;t have the willpower to hold the controller and play and not be in the right headspace to enjoy the game as it truly should be. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that my time and energy these last two months pivoted to reading some more books, especially using audiobooks to be able to listen to the story progress while cooking or even just laying in bed, but not wanting to scroll through the e-book on my phone.\nIn the last two months I\u0026rsquo;ve read: The Algebra of Wealth by Scott Galloway, Sabriel by Garth Nix, The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett, Talking to my daughter about the economy by Yanis Varoufakis, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and The Devils by Joe Abercrombie. Quite a list!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also watched a lot of shows and movies: Squid Game Season 3, Shutter Island, Kraven the Hunter, Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, Ironheart, The Residence, Adolescence, No Country for Old Men, Say Nothing, Common Side Effects, Eyes of Wakanda, The Count of Monte-Cristo, Flow, Mountainhead, The Eternaut, Foundation, Elio, Jurassic World: Rebirth, and How to Train Your Dragon.\nSome other random things I\u0026rsquo;ve done over these last few weekends:\nHiking in the Grampians with Nandi and going off trail and just exploring Seeing the Winter Firelight Festival with some large inflatable humanoids, great live music and performances Taking a walk in the CBD (Downtown) and checking out the Melbourne Public Library and some book and comic book stores. Dog sitting lovely Rippa for a full week while a coworker was out in Sydney Taking a train ride to see an old steam locomotive and just sit down and read out in nature Cooking pierogis with my coworker Matthew and hanging out playing board games I bought a guitar hero controller and installed Clone Hero to play some fun songs and get my fingers moving to a rhythym game I\u0026rsquo;ve always had an itch to play Hosting a movie night with some friends I went to the dentist and the doctor after a few years of not going at all because of moving to Wisconsin and then to Australia Planning for my trip to Poland and my trip to Japan A Reflection on My Last Post Last post I talked about how I needed to get better at focusing my time into the things I want to spend my time on. I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that it\u0026rsquo;s just inevitable that work will be busy, and that I am too nice to limit the amount of effort I put into it. I enjoy working with my coworkers and my customers and without a family or pet, my life is just more flexible to be the one to step up and make things easier for others. Though, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that a few hours here and there, and the tired state I sometimes come back home feeling are hard to then get past to push myself to do more things. I find my mind competing with, \u0026ldquo;Hey you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this, what if you put some time into this\u0026rdquo;, with the realization that \u0026ldquo;If I put time into this now, I won\u0026rsquo;t actually get better in any way\u0026rdquo; unless I more rigidly create some goals. The best days in recent weeks have been when I was able to go home close to 5 PM and I knew what I wanted to do that day, even if that was just putting on a specific movie or dedicate time to reading.\nLast post I also wrote about how I want to do certain things, but not having the perfect conditions to be able to do it, and looking back at it two months later, my mindset has definitely shifted. I have since stopped complaining to myself that things are more difficult to do or more expensive to do and just being honest with myself whether this is something I am interested in doing. I bought myself a new rain jacket and some hiking pants because I think I will always be interested and willing to wake up early and go for cool hikes. I also, disregarding the price, decided to book a Christmas trip to go do a bucket list hike in New Zealand and even though the price is probably higher than I would have been comfortable with paying two months ago, now I am just pushing through to have the experiences I want to have. It\u0026rsquo;s mental suicide to try to juggle optimizing every little thing, and I have been known to skimp out on certain things because of trying to optimize price, or time, or effort. I put the time and energy into planning this, so I\u0026rsquo;m happy with dialing back on the lens of looking at it from a financial perspective. As long as there is an eventual balance, I deserve to not have to keep checking for cheaper tickets or hotels to stay at.\nI\u0026rsquo;m writing this blog post this week because the next couple of months are going to be busy. I\u0026rsquo;ll be flying back to Poland to see family I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen in almost 10 years in two weeks. Then October is going to heavily surrounding planning my trip to Japan and saving some money back up from this recent splurge of purchases.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"One Year and Counting With this blog post, I officially mark over a year out here in Australia. Man does the time fly by. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt busy and productive since my last post, though I also reflect against myself in a negative way and think that I should have done more with my time. Since the last time I posted, I finally made my way to a few more events in Melbourne beyond just having a fun time hiking. I really enjoyed my time at ACMI, which was a museum designed around the history of television, movies, and even things like video games. I was reminded that there are sometimes cool things that align with your own interests that happen to just come across out of nowhere. This time around, there was a specific event around Sci-Fi worlds in film and video games and it was cool to see some of the physical props that were used in different media. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to back in the Australian summer to see \u0026ldquo;Game Worlds\u0026rdquo; which will be releasing for a limited time at the same. I also ended up going to a candlelight concert and a theatrical performance of \u0026ldquo;Comedy of Errors\u0026rdquo; over the last month, both of which were pretty great!\nI also spent a large portion of May travelling back to the US and then helping my customer Singapore with come large weekend events and I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the importance and worthwhile effort to plan things and do the big things right. As a parallel, I was watching the Last of Us Season Two and I was reminiscing on how during one of the episodes (as well as in the game) there is a flashback that Ellie has to one of her birthdays where Joel takes the time to find a natural history museum with dinosaurs and space suits, etc. What stuck with me the most was the line he said about how sometimes its worth keeping things secret and putting a lot of time into making one specific day worth it. Of course, things are dramaticized in video games and movies and tv shows, but deep down at a fundamental level I want those kinds of moments and so it ends up being that you have to work towards those moments that stick in your mind.\nWhen I came back to the US, I had pushed myself to plan out some additional events, and I appreciate everyone who helped from their end on making those happen. When in Wisconsin, I got to go bowling with some of my coworkers and spent the rest of the initial weekend hanging out, playing frisbee golf, and being reminded of the midwest. I got to see a lot of people face to face again after a full year and got to go to dinner with my database administrator friends from UW Health. Afterwards, I flew back to New Jersey and spent a day playing It Takes Two with my sister, going to the Rutgers Gardens, playing board games (Splendor) with friends, watching some NBA Knicks playoff games at a friend\u0026rsquo;s new apartment, having a dinner at Olive Garden, hanging out with cousins and playing board games, finally winning a game of Azul, and then ending my week with a trip out to Hoboken to see my college friends and college campus again after four years, going to eat at a Korean BBQ and also meeting a friend at a park bench as they passed by going to a party. Sometimes in the hussle and bussle of everyday life, you forget that things like this are \u0026ldquo;what it\u0026rsquo;s all about\u0026rdquo;.\nThe rest of May and honestly June was busy with work and finding time to push and plan for some future trips. A part of me was rejuvinated seeing friends and family to push towards having these bigger vacation days committed. I now have purchased tickets for a September trip back to Poland and a November trip for the first time to Japan and I am excited for both. Ever since I started tracking these fun things in a big google spreadsheet, it\u0026rsquo;s felt very productive to see how much I\u0026rsquo;ve actually done in a year. Alongside my flights back to the US, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a lot of audiobooks and started using the Libby app more regularly. I\u0026rsquo;ve also picked up where I last left of with my TV shows and though my hiking has been less frequent, I did find the time to incorporate one trip out to a trestle bridge in Noojee. I also got to do some gaming nights with some friends from work playing Sunderfolk and then having a few weekends playing board games and having dinner at Matthew\u0026rsquo;s house and I appreciated spending the time to get closer with some coworkers. We still have one or two more days left to beat that game, but had to take a break as one of the crew was flying back to the US for work. Finally, I finished playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite games in recent memory and am looking forward to all the other big story-rich games that are still on my backlog.\nA Reflection on a Year and Some Things I Need to Work Through In the last month, I had to go through a quarterly 1-on-1 session with my boss Cory and we went through how things have been going as well as avenues for improvement and balance that would be healthy to pursue long term. I feel that I\u0026rsquo;m also drawing a lot of parallels with those talks back to my own personal life. If I had to describe the first year in Australia, I would jot it down as a year of breadth, expanding to try to do as many different things and saying yes where I could to just dip my toes into things here and there. However, just like with work, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve really honed in, in the last year on things that I enjoy doing or enjoy learning about. What I feel is missing is that I can\u0026rsquo;t spread myself across all these different places without just feeling like I\u0026rsquo;m not getting anywhere with any of them. I have to be honest with myself and settle on doing a few things and just letting some others stay on the back burner for the time being. I know what I like now, time to get better that those things and or increase my time and money dials on those things to get the most enjoyment out of them as I can.\nI also realized that I\u0026rsquo;m starting to feel demoralized about trying to use my time efficiently but not having the right avenues to do it. I want to plan more trips, but it\u0026rsquo;s honestly easier at this point to book a trip somewhere with a plane than to get a rental car so that I can get it and drop it off outside of business hours at an airport. I also find that renting is starting to annoy me. I want to have a buy more high quality things and make my space more around my own wants, but its not reasonable for me to be buying better quality things if I\u0026rsquo;m renting and I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure whether or not I\u0026rsquo;ll be staying in Australia. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s part of life, though. If I wanted things to be more stable and look to buy my own home, then I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have committed to three years of travel away from home. I need to find a good middle ground of being happy to buy things for myself without having committing to big purchases and for them to actually be things I will be using.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"Before Tasmania This month was a month of firsts for sure. With my mom flying out here and friends coming back in late February, the start of this year was hectic so it was good for me to get back into some casual fun with reading and watching shows and focusing on work. I kept playing some fun games with Dhruv as well, and was very pleased with the release of Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. While I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to finish these before I return back to the states (and therefore before the end of May), I have been enjoying scheduling time to play the new puzzle game and RPG. The stories of both are exquisite and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait so see how either of them end, but I don\u0026rsquo;t mind the slow journey of getting them to completion. Unless there is a surprise release, I very much believe both of these will be coming home with game of the year awards of some sort by the end of this year, and well deserved if so.\nTo get ready for my hiking trip in Tasmania, I did a 25 km with the Happy Hikers and it was nice to see them again after a few weeks of not being able to hike. Work had gotten busy since mid March with Singapore projects picking up, and realistically I don\u0026rsquo;t see it dropping off until at least July, but it\u0026rsquo;s weird as because I\u0026rsquo;m competitive and always aiming to do my best, it has been a fulfilling time at work, where I am unfortunately spending more time than I want to be doing work, but it is all purposeful and I can see the benefits of the extra time I put in. Singapore is going through a really hectic time where their team of 6 ODBAs all has some kind of project going on, but I am also being looped in each of those projects and giving support to each of them. It\u0026rsquo;s really crazy to think that at 27 years old I am one of the bigger voices as to why some things are possibly going to complete in a reasonable time for an entire country\u0026rsquo;s medical system (of course it\u0026rsquo;s not just me). Some time freed up on Thursdays as playing volleyball with my coworkers ended with the end of daylight savings time, but the time shift also put some extra stress at work as there was now an even worse overlap with the US working hours and Singapore got into the office an hour earlier than before. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that depending at the time of the year things are quite cyclical of whether or not I work more solo or pursue trying to be in more meetings that have overlap.\nI also started to talking with a girl I met on Bumble, Victoria, and it\u0026rsquo;s been really great getting to know her and just talking with someone closer to my age, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t from my work. We\u0026rsquo;ll be going to a museum tomorrow and it\u0026rsquo;ll be nice to meet in person!\nHiking in Tasmania I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more happy with my trip to Tasmania. I had been planning out this trip for at least a few months and it came down to even the last few days to get prepared for the logistics of it, having gone to Bunnings (the Home Depot of Australia) to buy a head lamp and some cables. My flight out and getting my rental car went pretty smoothly, though as I was trying to start my car in the parking lot, I was so confused why I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it to turn on. Turns out that the key that I was handed was out of battery so I needed to specifically put the FOB against the start engine button, which I needed to open up a youtube video to learn! Afterwards, I started driving out early to my first destination. I probably should have bought food while still closer to the city, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how small of a town I was going into for Port Arthur. I was still able to get a few things, but definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t eat as I was planning to for the two days that I was out at my camp site (A nice juicy tomato is great to munch on while hiking).\nDay One was pretty much set in stone from morning to night, and everything stuck to that schedule. I got to the hiking trail a little early, but I also needed to buy a national park pass so I lost some early time. Still, I found myself sitting and enjoying the views of Cape Raoul for about half an hour before moving on and driving back into Port Arthur for a ghost tour of their old prisoner buildings. I was impressed with my camera\u0026rsquo;s quality of capturing night pictures as some of them came out really well and the stars were really visible in the night sky, reminding me of how I enjoyed looking up at the stars in New Zealand back in 2019. Afterwards, I drove out to the Fortescue Bay camp site, and pitched my tent at around 9 PM and went straight to bed after eating some late dinner.\nDay Two had a simple plan, waking up early before the sun rose and walking all day to get to Cape Pillar, before heading back to camp. I initially woke up at 3:00 AM, but from my hiking yesterday it seemed my body said that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough time as I had thought I closed my eyes for only a minute when I woke back up again at 4:15 AM. Afterwards, I spent the next 45 minutes getting things packed up and safely put back in my car and changing into new clothes and washing my face and brushing my teeth at the bathroom nearby. I was fully ready to start walking at 5:30, and yet it was still pitch black as I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to see anything without my head lamp. I had to psyche myself into starting the hike at that time because a lot ran through my head about what happens if my lamp runs out of battery, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did start when I did. It turns out the first hour that I was walking in the dark, I was actually walking through the worst uphill portion of the day, but I was so full of adrenaline and it being pitch black, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even realize until I looked at the map afterwards that I had been going uphill the whole time. At one point I was stopped dead in my tracks when a wallaby jumped onto the track in front of me and with it\u0026rsquo;s red glinting eyes hopped right by my legs, almost brushing past me. The sun starting coming up at around the same time that the trail opened up to a more open field and I got a nice video of the early morning colors. The rest of the day was just more and more hiking. On the way back I made a decision to go back the way I came instead of a slightly longer, but new path as I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the energy to add an extra hour to my day. I got back to camp at 3:30, after 10 hours of walking, and spend the next hour pitching my tent back up and going back to sleep.\nDay Three had to have a slight pivot. As I was hiking on day two I realized I got more and more comfortable with hiking in the middle of the night and I tried to make a plan to go out to see Cape Huay for a sunrise, though when I woke up at 3:00 AM, it was pouring rain. I spent the next hour or so reading my book and eating an early breakfast in my tent, but the rain didn\u0026rsquo;t let up. I fell back asleep and woke up again closer to 6 AM when the rain let up. It was pleasant to see a few other kids around the camp site waking up at that time and the adults having hidden some easter eggs around for them to try to find and collect. It was a packed campsite, but there was only one or two people there that wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing a bigger, more casual style of camping. I was expecting at this point that my legs would be killing me, but it was pleasant to see that I could keep going without much lingering from the countless hours of hiking the days before. I guess I prepared well for the physical part of my hikes! Because I got up earlier that day, I ended up taking a little more time, bringing a foldable chair with me, to sit around different parts of the my track to Cape Huay. It was an overall nice morning and I found myself back earlier than I wanted, but at a good time as there was rain starting at noon and I got back at around eleven-thirty. As I was eating my lunch in my car, it did pour down a little, but not as much I would have expected. Either way, I drove further to some of the other places I earmarked on my trip as \u0026ldquo;if you have time\u0026rdquo; locations near the Tasmanian coast trail and the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen and Blowhole. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting too much after my amazing three capes the few days before, but I was pleasantly surprised by the coastline over there and so happy that I ended up doing them. I also ate some great fish and chips at a food truck nearby capping off a great third day. I drove back in the dark back to Hobart to get to my hostel and I came happily surprised that I got upgraded to a solo room. I guess not too many go to hostels the day after Easter. Nice.\nI got up early on my last day as I needed to move my car from the spot I parked at 8 AM and so I decided I would just leave the hostel early as well and drive up to Mt. Wellington for some views. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I got there early, because later in the day the clouds rolled in and the visibility got worse, but instead of being a normal person and just chilling and enjoying the views, of course I ended up committing to hiking some more. This time I didn\u0026rsquo;t take anything with me, and it was completely different hiking without a backpack on. I ended up hiking through the clouds on my way back and it was great to see the endless sea of clouds below me from the view points. A part of me wished that it cleared a little more, but I was not dissapointed seeing what I saw. It reminded me a lot of my hike out in upstate up Whiteface Mountain, though that was fully covered in snow and even more white. I ended up spending the last half of my day unwinding and relaxing in my car near the beach as I was waiting for my flight time. If I was able to get an earlier flight, I probably would have, but it was also nice forcing myself to unwind and just wait while still able to use my rental car instead of just getting back to my apartment earlier.\nBack to the US for Work and Vacation Next on my agenda is a trip back to the US for a work conference and then tacking on a week of vacation to see friends and family in New Jersey. It\u0026rsquo;s been over a year since I\u0026rsquo;ve seen my sister and my dad, and I guess that\u0026rsquo;s just part of life now. Ever since I moved for work to Wisconsin it had been like that, though I at least saw them during Christmas. This time, Christmas had come and gone. Easter, too. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s part of life, and I more strongly appreciate what my parents had to go through when they made the decision around my same age to move from Poland to the US, except under a lot less stable conditions than I have had with my job. Initially, I had been planning to do a lot of different things while I was back in the states with friends and family, but as the dates are getting closer and closer I realize that it\u0026rsquo;s a bit too optimistic to try to plan all these things under the restrictions of being there for one week. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to have some things that I want to end up doing in my back pocket, but it\u0026rsquo;s also sad that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a good time to do things like the escape room that I wanted to set up. It\u0026rsquo;ll probably still be a great time, but I am starting to respect the effort it takes to plan things and making memorable things happen that are usually reserved for holidays. It really is starting to hit, now that I have been in Australia over a year how fast the time goes and how proactive you have to be if you want to do the things you want to do. I have so many places I still want to see around Australia and I definitely want to go back to do some hikes in New Zealand, but they won\u0026rsquo;t be able to happen unless I fully commit to them the way I did Tasmania.\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m back in the US, I\u0026rsquo;ll also have to spend some time with my sister and dad to plan my trip in September back to Poland. It\u0026rsquo;ll be the first time I\u0026rsquo;ll be back in Poland in almost 10 years and so everyone I had seen will be so different, and yet other things like my grandparent\u0026rsquo;s quaint little farm will probably be exactly the same as it was back then. I\u0026rsquo;m also looking forward to exploring parts of Poland I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen before, as I have always been going back to see family, I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen too many places beyond the places my uncle took me on our road trip from the south to the north of Poland way back when.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"Seeing Friends in Sydney Near the end of February, a few of my friends from back in the states flew out to Australia and so I made sure that I went out to Sydney to meet them and have a fun few days with my best friends. It was the second time I was in Sydney, but the first time that I was able to actually explore and enjoy my time out there. Previously, for work, I had stayed glued to my hotel room and making sure that my business trip went well. This time around, we got to do some adventuring. My trip started with some walking around the Opera House and botanical garden area of the city and we eventually made it all the way to St. Mary\u0026rsquo;s Cathedral and King Street Wharf. As it hit evening, me and my best friend Dylan went into the Opera house to watch a live D\u0026amp;D session get played, and it was honestly one of the best shows I had experienced live. I had seen some live comedy and broadway shows back in New York, but nothing with the level of engagement that this show had. Each attendee was given a character that they were able to vote for certain pivot points in the story on, which did end up changing the endings, and it became a story that I know only me and a handful of strangers in the crowd were able to share that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist for anyone else. We chose character names, and the decisions we made ended up impacting the ending. Super great. Dylan was actually selected to go up on stage, and I was selected to give an adjective for the villian at the very end of the story. I came up with squeeky, while another attendee in the audience made him a sailor (we wrote these choices on cards ahead of the show starting and they were picked out of a hat).\nThe next day, I spent some time seeing some of the more suburban areas of the surrounding Sydney area. My friends initially flew down for a YuGiOH convention that was being held in Parramatta, and so I made sure to go and see what that was all about for half the day before heading back and exploring a few comic book stores, book stores, and hobby shops around downtown. Window shopping is great, even if I literally had no room in my backpack to even consider making a purchase. It also helped me figure out a few gifts to bring back to the US for my trip in May.\nOver the weekend in Sydney, half the champs were working the YuGiOh conference, so I had a walk with Dylan out to the Bondi to Cogee Beach walking trail and I really enjoyed the views. We decided to move the date to one where it was more cloudy and I think that was a good plan as we were out there for a while, but never got fully burnt. We did get a little sunburnt on the first day walking around the city.\nThen finally, with my mom bringing my full license back in January, I rented out a car for Monday and drove everyone out to see the Blue Mountains and we did a day trip for hiking a few recommended tracks from my hiking group and ended the afternoon by seeing the Three Sisters. On the drive back, we met with a few of one of the locals that my friends knew from the YuGiOh conference and we made dinner plans at a fancy all you can eat seafood buffet. It was pricey, but I ate oysters and swordfish for the first time, and had some good crab legs and lobster tail as well. The buffet also extended to some other more common meals with lamb and some indian food. I also tried passion fruit for the first time and really liked the tanginess from it, and the experience was worth having.\nBack to the Basic and Simple Joys Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much time between the Great Ocean Road with my mom and flying out to Sydney, a big chunk of the beginning of this year was spent doing fun travelling and less time in my apartment. When I got back from Sydney, things started to fall back to normal. I spent some extra time catching up on some shows that I had fallen behind on and then I also committed some extra time to play some video games together with my friends co-operatively. I had already decided that I would previously purchase \u0026ldquo;It Takes Two\u0026rdquo; so that I could play that with my sister when I flew back to the US in May, but in the middle of March, the same studio released \u0026ldquo;Split Fiction\u0026rdquo;. I had previously tried to host a co-op game like it with my best friend Dhruv who was back in New Jersey, but the game was unplayable because of the latency travelling across the sea. This time though, I committed to buying a better internet package (more megabits for me please) and we had a lot better performance. And on top of that the game was a blast. Ever since I moved to Wisconsin and life got busy with work and typical adult chores I kind of fell off of playing games with anyone. I no longer really play multiplayer video games, and instead fell into playing single player games, but there\u0026rsquo;s just something truly joyful about playing co-operatively with someone else and aiming for a goal. I ruined my sleep schedule to make it work with time zones, and Dhruv likely did the same from his end, but in the end it was worth the extra planning to make it work. We\u0026rsquo;ve also played a few puzzle games, which are single player, but we share the screen of and kind of give hints to the person controlling the game itself. Since puzzle games don\u0026rsquo;t require quick inputs and more thinking, it works super well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s reminding me that I also want to play some board games when I go back to the US, or maybe take all my friends out to an Escape Room for a day. My sister also has \u0026ldquo;The Box\u0026rdquo; by Neil Patrick Harris that maybe I should just play with the friends when I\u0026rsquo;m out there. I tried to buy the second box that released earlier this year, but the cost to ship to Australia was more than the box itself so I quickly threw away that idea. I played Root for the first time with some coworkers as well and it was a super fun half day activity and so I just need to play some more board games. I know there\u0026rsquo;s a bar nearby that holds board games you can play and drink some beer and eat pub food, so I should go. The only reason I haven\u0026rsquo;t already is that it kind of feels weird to go alone, but I just need to head out and make some local friends my age.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a more general list of other things I had done since the start of this year, as well as what I still plan to do before I fly out to US in May:\nVideo Games:\nCompleted Dredge, Dishonored, Jusant, Sifu, The Roottrees are Dead, The Case of the Golden Idol, The Rise of the Golden Idol, Split Fiction Currently planning to watch Dhruv play Outer Wilds and I have Firewatch and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on my list. There are also two games I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to coming out in April to play: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Blue Prince. Books:\nCompleted Tao Te Ching, In the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s Words, and Meditations on First Philosophy as part of my Philosophy reading project for the full year. Completed Play Nice, and At Home: A Short History of Private Life. Still reading Stormlight Archive: Wind and Truth but hope to finish before the end of March. Planning to read Walden during my trip camping out in Tasmania. Movies:\nWatched Anatomy of a Fall, The Castle, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Watched Conclave and A Real Pain prior to the Oscars Watched Logan, The French Dispatch, and Last Breath as part of my backlog of movies Watched The Gorge on my birthday back in mid February Planning to watch The Brutalist and need to watch M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story as I told my analyst in Singapore I would watch that cricket movie and I think it\u0026rsquo;ll be fun to watch a sports movie TV Shows:\nWatched Interview with the Vampire, Hacks, Secret Level, Win or Lose, and Prime Target. Only Win or Lose stuck out as worth recommending to others. Finishing up Sakamoto Days, Severance, and Solo Leveling this month as the final episodes release Also planning to stay up to date with 1923, Daredevil Born Again, and The White Lotus as episodes release. Probably download Timeless, Pachinko, and Pantheon to watch on my flights back to the US. Images and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"The Great Ocean Road Over the month, I had done a lot of planning around making sure my mom had a great time when she visited me in Australia. I may be missing a few of the casual pictures from this time period in this shared folder, but there\u0026rsquo;s enough from just my trip down to the Great Ocean Road that I think you should go straight to just viewing the images link below.\nI was so glad that I was able to rent a car with my new license without any questions and that I felt comfortable driving on the other side of the road. The last of driving itself was over 7 hours, and I while we had a little break back at my apartment, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel bad going through most of it. Because of this, I have already booked two more car rentals. One with my friends in Sydney at the end of February and another one for my first ever camping trip that I am planning to do in Tasmania over Easter weekend. I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt this happy about the future trips I had planned on my schedule in a very long time and I am looking forward to them so much.\nAfter my trip in Sydney, I expect that March will be a slower month. I will focus a lot of my time on work and getting Singapore ready with finishing their storage migration and prepping for their second DR cutover. In my free time I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do some nearby hikes so that I can test the camping equipment I bought for Tasmania and so that I can make sure my body can handle the schedule I have laid out for it.\nI also plan to push myself to finish a few books and play through Final Fantasy Rebirth, all of which together are probably close to 150+ hours of commitment, so I have plenty of things I am happy to spend my time doing beyond just hiking coming up!\nWithout further ado, please enjoy the videos and pictures.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"Big Plans If I\u0026rsquo;m being honest with myself, I think it\u0026rsquo;s more and more likely that these posts are going to turn into a monthly thing, instead of a bi-weekly thing as things have turned into normal life again. Last year ended with a some relaxation and some self reflection. I have now been living in Australia for over 9 months, and approaching the first year mark. Time moves so quickly that it\u0026rsquo;s crazy to think that almost a year has passed since I have found myself out here. It\u0026rsquo;s been over a year now since I made the decision to do this crazy life change. I\u0026rsquo;ve realized there are things that I really do love about the decision, but I also find myself lonelier than I want to be. During the holidays and now with my mom flying out here for a trip, it hit me pretty hard that a lot of my life for the last year has been solo. I find time to read books, play games, and watch tv shows, but I also find myself just wanting to do things with others more and more. I am truly grateful for the hiking group that I attached myself to, but beyond those events, a lot of my time has been spent taking walks around the city and doing a lot of thinking. I also realized how much I rely on pushing myself to do new things and get out of my own comfort zone to find fulfillment. It\u0026rsquo;s been really easy for me to fall back into bad habits, like eating less in general, but also less healthy and spending my time doom scrolling.\nSomething I started two years ago was writing to myself and putting to paper things that I want to strive to do as my new year\u0026rsquo;s resolutions. Overall, this year, I find that they have not really changed at all. I find myself still wanting to do the same things, and finding that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done the ones that I had wanted to do last year. It\u0026rsquo;s probably better for my bank account and my future retirement, but I am pretty content with the things I do and they don\u0026rsquo;t cost much to be able to do them. I am happy to find a book and spend time reading it. I enjoy video games and I had been playing through a backlog of games that I already owned. I like hiking and there\u0026rsquo;s really only transportation costs for that. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to drink, or go out to clubs. I\u0026rsquo;d rather a quiet evening with a show playing. But I\u0026rsquo;m also recognizing that the things I like to do are things that people tend to do on their own, and so I\u0026rsquo;m finding that I need to make a physical exception in my day to day to do things that would let me meet new people.\nThat being said, while I started this post out pretty negative in myself reflection, I think I also tend to skew towards being hard on myself, to try to push myself to be better and usually that\u0026rsquo;s by reflecting on things that haven\u0026rsquo;t been going so well that could be improved. There have been some great things as well. I think throughout the year my time at work has changed from doing the work to make sure things go smoothly for my customer (but also to make my future self\u0026rsquo;s life easier) to more of a push by my customer\u0026rsquo;s to make sure everyone is doing the right thing. I\u0026rsquo;m looking to get involved in more impactful work with prospective customers and region wide initiatives that will hopefully get me more involved with colleagues.\nI also have a ton of trips planned and things that I want to push myself to do this year. Already, my mom has flown out to Australia using one of my company\u0026rsquo;s personal flybacks and it\u0026rsquo;s been great to see her. We spent some time with her and my aunt walking near the city and Australian Open and I left them to go on a two week cruise around Australia and New Zealand. At the same time, my mom brought with her my updated driver\u0026rsquo;s license from the US, where I now have a fully valid (non-probationary) license. I\u0026rsquo;ve planned to go on the Great Ocean Road with my mom near the beginning of February and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to start to take some time off from work to enjoy life. In 2024, outside of one trip I did with one of my best friends from NJ to Washington state to use my vacation days before they were converted away, I took one day off from work to extend a trip to Tasmania that I wrote previously about. I have a lot of days off that I banked and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that I can relax some of the grind that work has been to go off and experience and enjoy some things around this part of the world. After the Great Ocean Road, if all goes well with the driving I plan to figure out a trip for Easter back to Tasmania to hike the Three Capes and camp out for the first time in my life. I\u0026rsquo;ll also be flying out to Sydney in late February to see some friends and flying back to the US in early May for a conference at my work and extended that a week to see family and friends back in New Jersey. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that this year will be a healthier balance of personal endeavors, but also spending extra time with people and being less solo about things. I\u0026rsquo;m most ecstatic about the ability to rent a car so that I can maybe fly out to New Zealand for an extended weekend or just be able to drive to some further hikes and national parks around Australia that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to do on my own until now. My mind is already thinking of all the different options, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get ahead of myself and want to make sure I feel comfortable after this initial road trip.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also realized that I need to be honest with myself and how I use my time, based around my own personal goals. In the past, for both work and school, I\u0026rsquo;ve tended to push to achieve goals that are beyond me, not by cutting back on things that I already do, but by putting more time in general to these things. If I wanted to learn more or try a new thing, I would continue to do the things I already do but just put more time ontop of that to try to achieve that new thing. That\u0026rsquo;s not possible with my life goals. When I put more time into work or school, I would typically take that time out of the time I used for life. I never got good at cooking or whittling or learning to play the piano because work encroached into that time, even if not by simply taking up a bigger chunk of my time, but also by putting my mind into a state where I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn something new.\nThis year is going to be my year of taking things slow, but doing things right. I would describe last year as my year to try new things. I rarely revisited movies, shows, games, and experiences after going through them once. I tended to push towards trying more and more, even if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually reflecting back on those experiences and having it be worth my time. This year, I have a better plan. I have a set of books I want to read, and I know what it takes to keep to the time frames I have set for myself. I know that I liked the bigger trip I took to Tasmania a lot more for hiking then all the smaller hikes that filled my weekends so I want to push to doing more of those. I want to spend my time more efficiently, versus just finding ways to spend my time. When I played my video games, last year my goal was to try to play through as much of the backlog of games that I could so I could put a dent in it, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t taking into consideration my own mood when playing the games so with some of the smaller ones I pushed myself to play through it, even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I wanted to. This year, I\u0026rsquo;d like to reorganize my priorities and have committed time to doing the things I like to do, but also some committed time to doing things I have not tried before, and in order for that to be healthy, I need to take time away and set boundaries for myself. I need to commit to a more rigid schedule and I need to plan more, or else I will fall into my lazy habits again. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be watching a movie or tv show and multitasking on my phone or on a second monitor if I truly want to be watching what I am. My favorite show of this year was one that I committed the time to watch on the couch using my TV as I knew from episode one that it would be something I was going to truly enjoy. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be reading a book and having my mind wander to thinking about something else and forgetting what I was reading. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be marking things complete without actually getting something out of them.\nI want to commit myself to making an atmosphere where I can focus on the thing I want to do, and if I am not in the mood for that, I will find a way to make myself be in the mood, not by dropping the thing I want to do, but by thinking of what it would take for me to better align my inner goals with what I am actually spending time on.\nHere are things that I\u0026rsquo;ve also found myself wanting to spend time doing. I had previously decided it should always be twelve, for the twelve months in a year:\nGetting better at exercising consistently and getting my weight up. I want to feel better doing everyday things and I want to make myself more flexible as it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve always recognized I was horrible at. I want to spend the time to learn about architecture. I have an appreciation for putting a further effort into making something look nice, beyond just being functional and architecture always intrigued me on my walks and excursions abroad. I want to be able to learn more about geography and the facts of countries. I want to be able to hear cities and be able to pinpoint them on a map. I want to be able to know about major mountain ranges and rivers, and I want to be able to draw these out on a map if I ever needed to. I had started reading Van Loom\u0026rsquo;s Geography as a book I bought in a thrift store in Wisconsin and I fell in love to want to learn these \u0026ldquo;fun facts\u0026rdquo; that are probably only ever useful during a trivia night. I want to get better at cooking. I recognize that I don\u0026rsquo;t know enough recipes and likely don\u0026rsquo;t spend enough money and time to keep my body healthy and though I do not feel bad because of it on a typical day, I can sense a trend in the wrong direction that I want to change. I want to continue to play story-rich games and watch TV shows, but I realize I need to scale back on the amount of time I spend doing these things because it is an easy place for me to lose time to, especially during weekends where I can do other things only during those more extended periods of time (like travel and do multi-day hikes) I want to hike, but to new and exotic places. I want to do bucket list things and I don\u0026rsquo;t want anything to stop me. In a perfect world, I would like to be able to pick a random place in the world and feel comfortable to fly there, rent a car, book accomodation or pack a tent, and enjoy my time out in nature. I want to be able to sprinkle this into a typical three day weekend without having to rely on using vacation days to book one of these trips. I want to spend more time and share more experiences with people. I want to do more whittling, or woodworking, or some kind of artisan skill with my hands where I can make things to share with the people closest to me. More recently I think leatherworking would also be pretty cool and a nice way to be able to gift things that are unique to people while also getting better at these hand-crafts. I want to continue to weed out the bad from my life. Spending less time wasting time with doom scrolling. I want to find a way to push my mind towards using that time better with writing or reading or just taking a walk to get my mind of things. I want to find a way that when I do find myself having time in the day I don\u0026rsquo;t waste it doing something dumb. I want to get more consistent at doing the bare minimum to keeping a healthy body and mind and not using that time as something that I can eat into if I am more interested in doing other things with it at the time. I want to sleep a certain amount each day, keep up with daily routines and then taking the time away from other things or being content with stopping early when doing other things. I want to wake up earlier and go to bed earlier. When reflecting, I find most of my best days start when I have more time in the morning and the bad habits compound from that. I don\u0026rsquo;t make a better lunch or feel worse throughout the day if I run out of time in the morning. I want to spend more money, but on things that matter to me. I have it, but I tend to over save and not use it. I should push myself to do more hobbies and try new things by committing to them with money. Don\u0026rsquo;t be scared to spend a few hundred on something I know I will want to use or don\u0026rsquo;t be scared that I \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo; my money if it is something I end up not liking. Don\u0026rsquo;t be scared to book a trip somewhere because of price, but don\u0026rsquo;t be dumb about it. Images and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"A Relaxing End to the Year It\u0026rsquo;s taken me a while to get back into writing these posts as there is less and less that is happening on a day to day that I find myself wanting to journal about. As much as I wish for my life to be full of adventure and crazy excursions, the reality is that I really only take pictures and blog about the the big planned trips and the crazy life experiences. As we get closer to the one year mark our here in Australia, there are less of those that organically happen and there\u0026rsquo;s more energy required to make those happen myself, and to be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m in a weird place where while I want to continue to do fun and crazy things, I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to always spend the only time outside of work during weekdays planning for the weekend events to do those types of things. There were a few hikes that I had my eyes set on to solo over the last month and figuring out public transportation to and from those locations just added so much extra activation energy to the day, that it partially stopped me from doing them early. Even then, both of my hikes ended up being more like last minute changes into eventful walks as I found one of places closed by the time I arrived (Hanging Rocks see pictures) and another unavailable from the train as it was being fixed and replaced with a bus service (which I did not no about until I was sitting on the bench waiting for the train that never came).\nBeyond that, there\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of long term trips I found myself planning that put into perspective how much I could do in a year (by taking vacation days) beyond the ones I already had tentatively planned. In this last year, I only took one day off from work, outside of holidays, since arriving in Australia and yet even with that extra amount banked from this year, next year it looks like I\u0026rsquo;ll end up using a lot of the days I\u0026rsquo;ll have available, with a trip to Japan and Poland tentatively in the books and some additional days added to my flight back to the US for work to take some time off in New Jersey with my family. I weirdly love and hate logistics for that, because while someone has to plan to make great and awesome things happen, it tends to always fall back on me. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to understand the appeal of travel books like LonelyPlanet and why travel bloggers exploded in popularity on youtube, because there is definitely a market for those things.\nBeyond that, I ended up watching two of my coworkers pets, Marshmallow and Merlin, which always is a pleasure. There\u0026rsquo;s a nice balance of being the cool uncle where I can enjoy hanging out with dogs and cats without the long term commitment to having one. I started thinking more and more about it, and eventually I am starting to lean towards the cool opportunities and fun I would have with a dog, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to be committing to one while I\u0026rsquo;m still not fully settled down. I do think a dog would be good for me, though, as sometimes I fall into these ruts where I become a lazy bum, but with a pal to keep me company and force me to still be acting I feel like I would fall into those less often.\nI also took the opportunity over Black Friday to buy myself a few things, specifically some linen shirts to wear as the temperature increases over here and a leather, refillable journal to let me jot down notes and ideas wherever I go. I think I still have to get more comfortable with just writing to write in my journal, as I find myself not wanting to use it because I don\u0026rsquo;t think the idea or thing I am thinking about is worth putting into the expensive journal, but I need to get across that mindset, otherwise I\u0026rsquo;ll fall into a pattern of not using it at all which is against the whole point.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"A Busy Month It had been quite some time since the last time I posted, but not too much had been happening outside of work over the course of October. Generally, work had picked up in preparation for a DR cutover that one of the customers I support in Singapore and so much of my focus even outside of normal business hours was making sure that things went smoothly with that project. I wanted to make sure that we had plenty of time to talk through and plan the event. Some of those work days had me staying until 7 PM to accomodate the time shift of 3 hours with the country of Singapore. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this entry now from the airport lounge waiting to board onto my flight to Singapore to help with said event. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to visiting the country and meeting my coworkers and colleagues that I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with 20-25 hours per week with and I\u0026rsquo;m crossing my fingers that the event ges well and leads us to having a more frequent back and forth crossing between running in both data centers.\nI also took some time to search and see what things there were to do in Singapore at night. When I flew out to Sydney for my other customer\u0026rsquo;s non production build trip, I spent a lot of extra time in my hotel researching and optimizing our time together on site as we were falling behind completing what we wanted to during the trip. Because of that I didn\u0026rsquo;t walk around and actually see much of Sydney. I don\u0026rsquo;t want this trip to be the same. I prepared a bunch of topics and me and the ODBAs have done a ton of work in preparation of the event, so I want to actually enjoy my time, eat some good food, explore some touristy spots after work and chat with coworkers. Evan, out in the Singapore office, is already planning to find some place for dinner one of the nights and I bought myself a ticket for Sunday (after the DR event) to go to the ArtScience Museum for a Studio Ghibli exhibit. I brought my 360 camera as well and hope to take plenty of pictures with my ODBAs and of the beautiful country I\u0026rsquo;m landing in. Even though it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s suppose to rain for the entire week I\u0026rsquo;m there, I don\u0026rsquo;t care. My mood is positive and this will be a great trip, even if I have to will it into existance.\nAfter I come back, I also plan to take a trip to Tasmania during the longer Melbourne Cup weekend on the first week of November. October was a pretty boring and work filled month, but today is the day it all turns around back to some extra fun. One of the most important things that I\u0026rsquo;ve taken to heart was hearing from people I respect tell me that it\u0026rsquo;s always important to have something to look forward to, be it a trip, a new tv show, a video game, a concert, a book. Part of what got me through October was looking forward to this trip, even it is above all other things for work. I\u0026rsquo;m also looking forward to starting to play in the volleyball league that kicks off when I arrive back. Technically a few weeks had already started in October, but both weather and work got in the way.\n"},{

  "content":"Singapore for Work Busy, busy, busy. That\u0026rsquo;s been the story of October so far and all of it has been in preparation for the trip to get to Singapore and help with the first DR cutover my customer was performing over the upcoming weekend. Even though I had been working with hospitals for almost three years now, you never really have an opportunity to do too many things in person to gain perspective of what you are working on and how many people it affects. That\u0026rsquo;s where events like this really do ground you back to reality to remind you that there are usually thousands of people relying on using the system you keep up and operational 24/7. I had only ever been on site at two other customers and both of those were during implementation trips where the customer was first starting their journey with Epic, and so while it was important to get work done during those trips, I never had this large/planned event with all the other applications in the loop as well.\nFor the first few days, I was focused on work and making sure we all felt as comfortable as we could leading into the big event, and it was the first time in my time at Epic where we had dozens of people sitting together throughout the night all around a conference table. I made sure to get as much sleep as I could the night before and all of Saturday I stayed within my hotel room, forcing myself to sleep more than my body wanted. In the back of my head, since early October, and maybe even earlier, I always felt that this being the first DR cutover we were doing, something would inevitably come up, and yet there is only so much you can do to prepare to try to mitigate it. I\u0026rsquo;m not the most technical Server Systems person on the team, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even say I\u0026rsquo;m close when compared to others in my tenure, but I made sure to review different areas of what could go wrong together with the Singapore ODBAs, but also on my own time to give myself the best shot at making this a successful trip. And of course, as we sit down getting ready to run the first command of the night that initiates the cutover we hit an error. While I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to single-handedly lead the team around the errors we were seeing, I was happy with my own abilities to recognize problems and efficiently communicate the items back to the experts who I looped into the problems. Some issues I was able to handle on my own\u0026hellip; others I felt like I was on the right track but just missing the couple of years of experience to know what keywords to search for in log files or connect certain error messages with issues, but my troubleshooting path was at least going to the right commands or files to search for the next steps. While we were expected to be completed with the work by 4 AM, we ended up working through resolving problems throughout 7 AM, and Monday would have us working through 10:30 PM resolving some of the residual issues, some of which I self inflicted when working on investigating other issues the night of the cutover.\nTo some extent I am grateful for the experience of being the one, as Zhi Long, one of the ODBAs at Singapore said, \u0026ldquo;in the hot seat\u0026rdquo; for the event. Again, in my role at Epic, I work with supporting our customers, but rarely am I ever the one that needs to experience first hand an issue that I don\u0026rsquo;t know well enough where the real next steps are simply to escalate and reach out to further support staff. Usually, I\u0026rsquo;m the one being reached out to, and so it gives a better appreciation for the empathetic side of knowing what someone I may be supporting is going through. I had initially planned to spend the time in Singapore enjoying time with my ODBAs and learning more about their lives outside of work and simply chatting, but I realize that, at least for me, something always seems to pop up and demand my attention, and I can either ignore it and enjoy my time or face it head on and come out on the other side with new experiences to shape me as a person. Maybe there will be another trip sometime next year where things will go smoothly and then I can sit back and enjoy the fruits of all the planning and work that lead to it, but until that time comes I\u0026rsquo;ll be down in the trenches working as hard as I can so that everyone else feels more confident.\nSingapore for Fun Beyond the stress of work and some days coming back to the hotel room late or staying up late to write up documentation of the night before, I did have two days to explore Singapore and see all it has to offer. When I first landed in Singapore, I think the thing that caught my eye the most was the complete 180 of temperature and humidity as well as the large amount of skyscrapers and glass structures all around. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there are many places in the world where you can look in multiple directions and see skyscrapers on all sides. Typically, what I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced is that cities have a downtown and that downtown is the area that is built up towards the sky, however in Singapore it was as if there were multiple subsections of these areas, where every so often another group of skyscrapers showed the next larger hub. On one of my first days, Thursday, after work, I made a last minute decision while talking with Xiaobin, one of the ODBAs, that I think I might just walk home from the office we were working at to my hotel. It was a two hour walk, but I felt like I got to see more nooks and crannies and the real energy of the city than I got to see on some of the other days exploring more central tourist areas. I made further split decisions like this throughout the trip, talking a walk to see the National University of Singapore also on a split decision right after work and then walking around Sentosa past sunset where I definitely got lost in one of the larger parking garages for like half an hour, haha.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I find myself most happy just walking around and taking in the different buildings and auras that different parts of a city give off. I had always had a deep respect for architecture, and I always think back about how, if I had gone to university a few years after I did, I may have made a different decision where instead of going for electrical engineering I would have went for architectural design. It\u0026rsquo;s always been something that I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to explore more of, but I am content with not having the time that I want to at the moment to get into it. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a few books, and I\u0026rsquo;ve kept a spreadsheet on some of my walks from the US and from other countries about different styles. Singapore had it\u0026rsquo;s own unique neighborhoods, and while I was really impressed with the large concrete and glass skyscrapers with live plants flowing out of their crevices, I also had a similar respect to some of the simpler buildings and skinnier, European-like alleyways that connected cities. I could definitely feel that the buildings in Singapore where created with more love and motivation for new ideas than many of the cities in the US are and their cookie cutter mass-produced buildings. All in to say, I think that the density and the multiple layers of interest created a more interesting place to walk through and explore, even more so than some of the tourist places like Marina Bay Sands or Sentosa were able to create within me.\nOn Sunday, after the DR cutover event, I had decided to not go back to my hotel room to sleep, even with being up for the last 12 hours actively working on the event, but instead I went to the hotel to shower, eat breakfast and talk out to start going downtown and towards Chinatown and Marina Bay Sands. Looking back, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I had the energy, but I stayed out, doing a lot of my travel by walking not by taking any public transportation, until around 7 PM, at which point I got back to my hotel and fell straight asleep. On Wednesday, due to a change in plans for when we were going to be cutting over the Reporting environment, I ended up having a day to explore Singapore as it was initially suppose to be a recovery day leading into traveling back to Australia with some additional after hours work. While I had done some exploration in the main city in the previous days, I decided to go walk in their central greenspace and park. I ended up taking whatever route I was feeling in the moment, ended up walking near some highways, going through a cementary, a golf course, and eventually finding myself in a forested area with a ton of monkeys that I did not know would be there.\nI think spending multiple days in the humid heat of Singapore had also solidified in my mind that I am definitely a colder, winter person. I prefer to be able to put on more layers versus walking and sweating and having to have a change of clothes ready every day due to the sweat. Even here in Australia I have yet to turn on the A/C or Heat as it\u0026rsquo;s more plausible to be able to huddle up with a blanket if it\u0026rsquo;s cold or open up a window and air out the room if it\u0026rsquo;s getting stuffy. That being said, the water at the beach in Sentosa was definitely the warmest water I had every stepped foot in, and I can see why people would like to go to beaches and holiday there. I\u0026rsquo;m just not sure it\u0026rsquo;s for me as a permanent place to live.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"Hiking in Tasmania It took a while for me to get down to writing this post and part of it was me being inconsistent with writing my blog, but another part of me wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly sure what I wanted to say about the trip. I think the pictures speak for themselves to show that I really did enjoy my time. This trip to Tasmania was my first day off from work that I took off since moving out to Australia, and I am looking forward to doing more trips like this, but I do think it was partially a good trip because of the people and planning that took part it in beyond me. The more and more time I spend in Australia, the more I get complacent and back into my normal routine, finding myself falling back to using my computer and phone more than I want to and staying at home like I tended to do in my past. It makes me more thankful that when I did move I spent the extra effort to find a group of locals that were into hiking, as without it I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I would be able to do as many things as I have as I enjoyed so far in Australia.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a real beauty to being a passenger princess when it comes to trips and not having to do much planning, but just reaping from the benefits of it. I think as far back as I could remember, I have always been the one in my family to overplan trips to try to get them across the finish line. My mom had always had an idea of seeing the Grand Canyon, but if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for a lot of the things I looked into, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we would have done it back in March-April 2023. This trip to Tasmania, however, was the first time in a very long time that I was able to take the reigns off and really entrust a more expensive trip completely to others. Would I have done some things differently, sure. Could I have saved some additional money and found extra activities that I would have likely to do, most likely. But I\u0026rsquo;m very happy and content with the trip that occurred and I would without a doubt do it again the same way.\nThe trip didn\u0026rsquo;t start in the greatest way, though. I left work pretty close to 5 PM in order to take an Uber over to the airport. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll ever really get comfortable with getting to an airport anything other than absurdly early. To add to the extra waiting, the flight that was suppose to leave at 7 was delayed for over an hour and a half. On the other side, once we landed we were cutting it very close to closing time for many of the stores near us and we realized that there weren\u0026rsquo;t many places to get food once we started the drive over to our cabin near Cradle Mountain, so after we landed Arun quickly went to get our rental car and we rushed to get to Woolworths and had to pick out some food in under 10 minutes before the store closed.\nAfter, we drove back to the airport to pick up Anne who was on the last flight in and we started driving slightly past midnight. We ended up arriving at our cabin somewhere around 2-3 AM. Afterwards, though, the trip was a lot smoother. On one of the days I decided to split off from the rest of the group to do some additional hiking as I wanted to see as many routes as possible in the area and the group was planning to do a route that I ended up doing already the previous day as an addition beyond what we did together. That day was ended up being really windy and while I wasn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable getting on some of the peaks on my route, I was still happy doing the detours and pushing through my initial fears. I think I still get into my head around my skill level and heights whether or not something is truly as safe as it feels. Looking back, I probably exaggerated how I felt, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret not pushing myself through the wind I experienced either.\nOn the day of the summit, the weather wasn\u0026rsquo;t the greatest, and we ended up walking through a bunch of fog and rain for the first half of the day. Going up to the summit felt more dangerous and precarious than it probably was with the addition of fog and not being able to fully get a scope of what you were doing. However, on the way back, undoing our steps, as the fog lifted, the track felt a lot more manageble. It\u0026rsquo;s weird how so much throughout this trip weather dictated how I felt when doing the trails and how a slight shift in wind speed or fog completely altered the gut feeling of safety in me. I would understand it impacting my enjoyment and the views, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how much it plays against you when you find yourself alone and staring into fog both ahead and behind you.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ll let the pictures speak for the rest of the trip. If anything, a month after this trip, most of what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling is a pain of realization of how limiting it is to not be able to rent my own car and take these trips myself. I\u0026rsquo;ll have a pretty busy start to the next year with my mom coming by in early February, and then me taking a weekend to Sydney to see friends, possibly another trip to Singapore, and finally a trip back to the States for Epic\u0026rsquo;s XGM conference all before May. That being said, I do think I\u0026rsquo;m just going to find a weekend that\u0026rsquo;s extended due to a holiday and commit to doing the Three Capes in 2025. No point in not doing so. There\u0026rsquo;s also some trips that the rest of the hiking group is planning as well that I\u0026rsquo;m keen on joining in on.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"Where Does the Time Go? It\u0026rsquo;s now been more than five months that I\u0026rsquo;ve spent in Australia and I constantly look back thinking where did the time go? I think part of it might just be that I\u0026rsquo;m most at home trying to optimize the situations I\u0026rsquo;m in. Give me a situation with some fixed restraints and I find myself enjoying the time trying to piece together where to best spend my time and energy. However, I think as much as that kind of skill has been a blessing in my work life, on days where I let my mind wander and thing (especially during late night walks that I enjoy doing) I find myself second guessing whether I\u0026rsquo;m just living in a period of time where I am trying to check off all the checkboxes or whether when I look back at this point in life I have long lasting memories of my time in Australia. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that throughout my early adulthood the memories that stick with me are the ones where I push myself past the point of doing something smart and take a leap of faith into trying something new and original. A few months into owning a car I went on a weekend trip north in Wisconsin to Door County and slept in my car under three blankets. I went hiking and stayed into the pitch darkness in New Zealand. I pushed myself past my comfort zone and organized some trips in China beyond those that the summer internship company set up. These kind of memories have stuck with me because it was a moment where I could have easily chosen a simpler path or made my life easier, but then I would not have learned or experienced things in the same way. Sure, I could have bought a hotel or come back in the morning, or hired a guide to still do the same experiences that I did, but doing them the way I did let me enjoy them that much more.\nI say this because if you have been reading along through all my posts I may have kept you busy with all the hiking and tv shows and movies and video games that I\u0026rsquo;ve been listing off, but many, to me, have not had the effect of something that would stick in my mind as a core memory of my time in Australia. The last few weeks though, I experienced a hike that pushed me to new limits and helped put into perspective what I could do. I won\u0026rsquo;t babble on too much on the hike, but I have linked a video below and some images in for you to take a look at. At points, we went off trail and walked along the ridgeline carving our own path and figuring out the best way to get from point A to point B. At one point I froze up as there was a small rock climb down off a ledge and it was the only way to complete the loop, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy to have safely pushed myself beyond what I had ever done before. I\u0026rsquo;d been talking a lot about some of the adventures or trips that I wanted to do for myself, but honestly it\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of a crutch to fall back on the hiking group helping get me from one hike to the next. There is something that I\u0026rsquo;m missing through that you really only get to experience if you go hiking by yourself. Enjoying endless nature all around you with no other person in sight.\nWhy Am I Holding Myself Back? Today I watched a youtube video by Drew Gooden titled \u0026ldquo;Everybody wants to waste your time\u0026rdquo; and it really struck a cord with the way things have been going for me for the last few months, replacing Everybody with my own choices. Near the end of the video I\u0026rsquo;ll quote the lines that really resonated with the ways I had been doing things myself over the last few months. I tracked movies and video games in a list on excel and was always watching to mark things off the list itself than to do it sometimes for my own pleasure.\n\u0026ldquo;The way our attention gets pulled in every direction at all times also makes me feel like I should be multitasking always, or I\u0026rsquo;ll fall behind. I always feel like I\u0026rsquo;m missing out on something. There\u0026rsquo;s so many movies I want to watch and games I want to play, and there\u0026rsquo;s not enough hours in the day to do it all. So when I do get myself some free time I try to be overly efficient with it. I can\u0026rsquo;t just play a video game, I should be catching up on podcasts. Loading screen, perfect that gives me exactly nine seconds to scroll through social media. I\u0026rsquo;d hate to be bored\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve realized that by forcing myself down this hyper efficient road of doing as much as I can in the little time I may or may not have in Australia is causing weeks to blur and having me fall into some bad habits. Work at Epic has always been a kind of mental drain at the end of the day and I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in some previous posts that some of my push into watching more movies and tv shows stemmed from coming back from work and not even having the energy to want to hold a controller and give any input to a narrative video game story. I unfortunately don\u0026rsquo;t think that will go away anytime soon, but it has stopped me from pursuing some of the more artist endeavors that I hold somewhere in the back of my mind. I always wanted to play piano, I always wanted to get better at woodworking and carving and whittling. I always wanted to get more flexible and exercise and cook healthy and take care of my body, but as I find more and more things that are interesting to me, the less time I can devote to one thing and truly sink my teeth into it and get good at it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Time I Learn to Spend? Growing up, a lot of my hobbies tended to be on the cheaper end of things. I got big into video games because for a big upfront cost of buying a computer and a console, the things you could do with it or the bargain games you can get for it where limitless. When I was still in no more than upper elementary school my parents bought me a computer for Christmas and I stuck to using that same computer, a Windows XP, until I needed to get a laptop for college. I missed out on the whole PS3 and Xbox 360 generation of games and instead got big into them by going over friends houses and spending the time to play those games together with them. Realistically, I got big into hiking because it was one of the cheaper or free things to do once you sorted transportation.\nI went to the movies today for the first time in a very long time. The last movie I remember seeing was Avatar the Way of Water back in December of 2022, and yet I enjoyed both of my experiences immensely. I remember working night shifts in Indiana before Epic and going to see Spiderman No Way Home and having a total blast, and yet there\u0026rsquo;s always something in the back of my mind nagging me about spending the money to go out and experience it in a huge theater because I know it\u0026rsquo;ll be free in a few months on some websites. I started watching Ramit Sethi on youtube because it\u0026rsquo;s honestly been a struggle to adjust my mind to being okay with spending. The optimizing part of my brain wants to keep saving and saving and min/maxing the opportunities I have, but deep down I know that I\u0026rsquo;m just ruining it for myself. Why do I get in these situations where I know I am doing something I want to be doing, but purposely ruining the experience for the sake of making sure I don\u0026rsquo;t make a mistake.\nI want to change the approach that I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking in situations to force myself to think less and just go with the flow and enjoy the moment or enjoy the pain of the moment. Why have I not been to a bookstore or a coffee shop yet in Melbourne? I know that there are certain books I want to read and there are certain atmospheres where owning a physical copy would make me enjoy it way more than a free ebook or audiobook that I force myself to power through when I\u0026rsquo;m not in the mood solely because it feels like \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t read in a while\u0026rdquo;. I also know reading the book when at the beach or in nature would elevate my experience and yet I pause and contemplate whether it\u0026rsquo;s worth the effort to buy a $5 metro ticket to get to that nicer location. It\u0026rsquo;s stupid, it\u0026rsquo;s insane, it\u0026rsquo;s unhealthy, and yet I can\u0026rsquo;t stop my mind from going down these rabbit holes of optimizing the fun and spontenuity of out things. The hike I went on this last week was fun and crazy and memorable because I forced myself to not look into it and I was pleasantly surprised by the unexpected fun and challenges I had.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the deal. I\u0026rsquo;m being dumb and dragging this on for too long. I need to call the Enterprise car rental agency downtime to see if I can rent a car with a P2 (probationary) driver\u0026rsquo;s license while in Australia. I need to leave work a little early to talk with my apartment complex manager to see how my parking spot works and if I could leave the car there overnight to make it easier to go somewhere over the weekend. And finally I need to pack my hiking bag with my foldable chair, a blanket, and my phone and hike over to the Hanging Rocks to hang out and enjoy the nicer weather we are starting to have. And I woke pack a lunch, to force myself to instead buy it at the cafe over there because for peethe sake I deserve not having to think about making food when there is delicious stuff near there for $20. I have until the end of the week to go to the Hanging Rocks for the extended weekend and if I can book a car with my current drivers license I am pre-booking something before I fly out to Singapore for my DR cutover trip. These are the tasks that have been lingering in the back of my mind for a few weeks now and I really need to just take it head on or I\u0026rsquo;ll keep finding the time slowly ticking away and finding that I have limited options to do the things I want to do.\nIf I can figure out the car, then I can do weekend flights to other places in Australia and explore some more and I can book a hike for the Three Capes Trail in Tasmania for next year.\nA Few Extra Notes That being said, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been playing a lot of Cyberpunk recently and I have been enjoying it a lot, but it\u0026rsquo;s starting to feel like I am forcing my way through my video game backlog and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to burn myself out before hitting some of the other games that I am insanely looking forward to (Red Dead Redemption 2, Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 3). I just need to rewire my brain to not always think about the min/max and to sometimes live in the moment. Knowing myself, though, it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine if I have to force those moments to happen because I give myself no other options.\nIn case you were curious, I went to see The Wild Robot in theaters and do recommend it for those that want a feel-good wholesome watch. The paintbrush style art was also splendidly crafted and really popped on the screen. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s worth watching just for the visuals.\nImages and Videos Images Here "},{

  "content":"Getting in Movies and TV Shows Back in 2017, I was going into my sophomore year at Stevens Institute of Technology. That same year, in around September, I remember MoviePass releasing at an all time low price of $9.95/month to try to spearhead the movie theater going experience to people around the country. For a college student, the price being so low was a real push for getting me into watching new movies and keeping up with things that were releasing at theaters. I remember that at that time, me and my roommates ended up going to see GeoStorm in theaters, a pretty horrible and low-budget natural disaster movie that I would have never seen if I had to pay more for it, but under the MoviePass deal ended up being a fun time. MoviePass ended up failing as a product as it was never ever able to turn a profit. It slowly got worse over the course of two years, but some of it\u0026rsquo;s effects lingered on in me. When I moved to Wisconsin in 2020 I started to get back into keeping up with the latest movies as it was something I could do to relax after a long day at work.\nAt this point, I try to keep up on a monthly basis with new releases for movies in theaters as well as TV shows. It feels great to find a show or movie to recommend to friends that hasn\u0026rsquo;t really exploded in popularity yet. I end up keeping a watchlist and spreadsheet of shows and movies that I plan to watch and I created a rating system for myself on IMDB to help organize my thoughts. I won\u0026rsquo;t go deep into that now, but I may make a future post around it.\nWhat I wanted to do with this post is put my own opinions and order to the 2024 Emmy nominees that came out recently. With the event happening in a few days I wanted to compare who I would choose to win the category and rank them in terms of my own interests. I usually use events like these to see if there was a show that also slipped under my radar that I should add to my watchlist. I used the following document to fill my list below. I won\u0026rsquo;t personally choose a show that I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched, even though I think it may win.

  "content":"I had gone through multiple decisions when coming up with an alternative to my approach to documenting my journey in Australia. While it initially started as a bunch of google documents with links to photos and videos that I had taken, I wanted to take it one step further in making it available for anyone to see in the world. And so I decided that I might as well make a website and try to figure out what it would take to host it and make it publically available, but also easy to manage.\nWith some other stuff at work having me learn AWS, I initially started my attempt there. I also knew that while wordpress and other Content Management Systems like it were popular to use, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need and didn\u0026rsquo;t want the bloatware that came with it and other things like bootstrap. I wanted to start simple, and was fine with developing things myself if I wanted to expand it from there.\nBecause of that, I started looking into things like static webpage generators and saw a few that caught my interest including Hugo, Jekyll, and Docusaurus. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can really tell you why I chose Hugo out of all the choices, but it seemed to be popular and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned throughout some of my other choices in life that sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just important to choose something, even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the perfect thing, instead of getting stuck in the world of analysis paralysis.\nI took some time to learn how to use it and create new web pages, which I am taking a video of for you here, and it seemed intuitive enough. Hugo also had a further templating system that was open source called Hugoplate, which I found by looking specifically into any available options in Hugo that used tailwind.css, a framework that I was intrigued to start using after learning about it when researching front-end CSS options at work. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video of me writing up this blog post itself. The only missing part at the end of the video would include me using the hugo command to build the new posts into a public folder and then using git to upload the new files to github to then update to the website.\nAt the current state, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the development pipeline I have here with Hugo, the HugoPlate theme, and Github Pages being connected to my own domain ($20/year). As I mentioned above, I tried to initially do this work within AWS and have it so that I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually upload google photo links to the images and videos, but actually stored the raw images and vidoes so that I could have them protected and accessible from anywhere, but after doing the math I found that it would cost me (and continuously go up) $10s of dollars a months to do that.\nI tried to then move it to do that attempt but in a self-hosted manner, thinking that I had the space on my own PC so I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to rent it out in the cloud, however I hit some issues with opening up the HTTPS port from my router to the public internet and so the website wasn\u0026rsquo;t accessible, even when it was running locally. At the end, I thought to move the files over to github and run the website as a github pages render and just point my domain to it. For the time, I think this works as regular text files aren\u0026rsquo;t that large in storage and really the only photos I am putting in the project are the ones for the header images and embedded into the posts themselves, which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a lot.\n"},{

  "content":"Two Months of Stuff Hey everyone! I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit that it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since my last post and that didn\u0026rsquo;t align with my hope to write one of these every two weeks. Throughout this time period, I passed my longest time living outside of the US in one trip. I had taken a few trips to Poland over some summers and internships abroad, but none of those lasted more than 13 weeks. Yesterday officially marked 20 full weeks living in Australia.\nPart of the reason why it took so long to write this was because life just got busy. Initially, I was planning to write a new entry a week after my last one, specifically talking about only my trip out to Sydney for work, but those two weeks ended up being a lot busier than I expected. The other reason was that I started to thing about how to make this website work in a more sophisticated way. A google docs entry every couple of weeks was a perfectly fine start, but I wanted to have more flexibility and I also wanted to present the information in a more unique way. Initially, because of some other work I had done during my trip to Sydney, I planned to move the whole system I had going for me to AWS and host all my images and documents in the cloud, however, in my initial pushes I realized that the price of that would add up just for the videos and photos that I would be uploading. I\u0026rsquo;m still open to figuring out a way to save my photos and have some data protection around them so I don\u0026rsquo;t lose them in the future, but simply for price I\u0026rsquo;m happy to continue to post my longer videos to youtube and the rest of my photos to google photos. Google gives you 15 GB of storage for free and so far just my Australia photos for this project have taken up 8.2 GB.\nTravelling to Sydney On July 8th I flew out to Sydney to help our Australian customer NSW Health install their non-production system. This was my first solo non-production install trip, but I think it went pretty smooth and we were able to get a lot more done than I initially thought, even though we ended up with a lot of follow up tasks to do in the following weeks. While I was super excited to go and explore a new city and I had written up a bunch of places I wanted to go to see, I actually ended up spending a lot of my time in my hotel room, continuing to research and prepare my own notes for the following days to go smoothly. Because it felt like every day we weren\u0026rsquo;t keeping up with the checklists we had laid out to do, I spent most of my time post 5 PM work continuing to optimize what we could do when we were back together the next day to catch back up. Because of that, I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to explore any of the city, outside of walking to the Opera House and viewing it for a few minutes prior to the first day\u0026rsquo;s tasks. Weirdly, though, I don\u0026rsquo;t regret my decision as I know we\u0026rsquo;ll have more trips to Sydney as we continue to work together on the project so I\u0026rsquo;ll have more opportunities to have some fun.\nThe Week After Most of the rest of the week following the trip out to Sydney was spent working to catch back up to where I wanted to be following our build trip and getting back into doing the work I missed with Singapore now that I was back. Brian was expected to go out to Sydney two weeks after our trip so I also knew that I had some backup duties in the office coming up. A bunch of other implementation folks were also planning to fly out to Sydney to start working with their analysts in the non-production environments we built out so I wanted to make sure they were fully ready for them on their trip.\nAnother office mate, Whitney, was also planning to be out of the office around that time for a trip to Thailand so I ended up cat sitting Merlin during the weekend. The same weekend, though was one where I went on a hike and as I don\u0026rsquo;t have a car I needed to get up early to go and walk over to Whitney\u0026rsquo;s apartment before then walking to a train to get to the city to then jump into a carpool and get to the hiking spot. I ended up waking at 4:30 AM, so I could leave the house at 5:00 AM and started hiking at 9:00 AM. On the hike we saw a baby lamb and got rained on but the spirits were high and it was a super fun day. After the hike, I was absolutely soaked, but I needed to stop by Whitney\u0026rsquo;s apartment before going to mine to make sure Merlin was still alright.\nA Couple Weeks to Slow Down With the non-production build trip behind me now, work had pushed towards me now having two customers to work on from now until the distant future, so there was a bit of time I needed to spend to reorganize myself and future proof myself from being overworked. Singapore still continues to have a lot of projects that have been taking place and upcoming, but we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to the point that we are proactively preparing for them ahead of time, instead of jumping on a call and having to solve or talk through projects that need to occur the same day. Upcoming this weekend (September 8th) there is a production upgrade that we have done a bunch of work to prepare for. I\u0026rsquo;ll be working after hours that weekend to make sure things go smoothly, but I\u0026rsquo;m strongly confident that things will go well.\nBecause of the last few weekends being heavily into hiking and work being busy, I spent a few weekends more relaxed than the others. The Happy Hikers group that I hike with continued to do hikes each weekend but I decided to not join a few of them. Instead I took a few weekends away from hiking to instead do some other things. The last weekend of July I went on my own walk around the Yarra River and found an industrial bridge that was fun to walk across and I spent some time reading some books out in some parks. Over the last two months, I finished reading Orconomics by Zachary Pike, listened to Fluke by Brian Klaas, and finished One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch.\nThe following weekend, I joined Cameron, Josh, Risa, and Cory from my office to play some volleyball because the weather was really nice out in St. Kilda. Afterwards I also found a spot on the beach to continue reading some of those books I listed above. The next day I joined a few locals and went to the NGV (National Gallery of Victoria) to enjoy a Pharaoh exhibit that was brought over from Britain to Melbourne for their winter collection. I enjoyed a weekend that wasn\u0026rsquo;t filled entirely with prepping lunch and packing for a hike to then hike all day and come back exhausted for the next day, but honestly realized that I enjoy the thrill of the outdoors more than the thrill of the city.\nMore Hiking and Planning for a Future Trip While I wasn\u0026rsquo;t hiking for a few weeks, I did still end up spending some time with Nandi, one of the members of the hiking group who is of Sri Lankan ethnicity. We ended up playing a few games of snooker over the last two months and he added me to his own exclusive Grade 5 Hikers group, planning to be part of people from the main group that wanted to do some more challenging hikes. The first one that we did was Srath Creek Falls in which we started at the top of the waterfall, and descended down into the valley to follow the river and end with a grueling scramble up from the valley back to the top to end the hike. Strath Creek Falls funnily enough is next to Mt. Dissapointment, but the day strayed away from that name, haha.\nI also committed some time out in November to buy some plane tickets and accomodation for a flight down to Tasmania in November with the hiking group and do Cradle Mountain. The first week in November has an extended weekend with a horse race that counts as a holiday happening on Tuesday so I\u0026rsquo;m taking Monday off as my first day off from work since arriving to have a longer weekend in Tasmania. Expect plenty of pictures and videos from that when it happens! It\u0026rsquo;ll also act as a good break from work as the weekend prior I\u0026rsquo;ll be flying out to Singapore to help with a disaster recovery exercise so the end of October + start of November will be full of personal and business travel.\nA Few Changed Commitments Back in Post #5, I listed a few commitments I wanted to make to myself while I was out here in Australia, and while a lot of them I still want to stick to in the grand scheme of things, the original ones have changed slightly.\nHere are the changes:\nI had wanted to travel out to New Zealand for a few days to meet my old coworkers and drive around the west coast of the Southern Island. I want to still do this, but I am planning to make this into a family trip near the end of 2027 so I can turn it into a two week trip and so everyone can bank the necessary days ahead of time. I previously wanted to explore some Southeast Asian countries along my travels to Singapore. Planning around my vacation days I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll have enough days to be able to do this anymore, but if I\u0026rsquo;m crazy I might fly out on a random weekend to only spend one or two days in said countries. I would want to spend the time in nature. I wanted to get more comfortable with overnight hiking and renting out a car in Australia to do longer weekend activities. In Post #7 I said that I would do a few of these things by the end of August but that just wasn\u0026rsquo;t realistic. I also noticed that the hiking group was planning to do some of the Wilson Prom\u0026rsquo;s hiking early next year so it makes it easier to tack on with them. I want to still rent out a car and figure out the logistics of that before the end of this year and spend a day doing the George Bass Coastal Walk. I also want to commit that at one point I will specifically do the Three Capes Track in Tasmania. I may commit to buying the ticket for this if I enjoy my time doing Cradle Mountain in November. I did buy a lightweight collapseable chair and Osprey Talon Velocity 30L hiking backpack to start my commitments. Images and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"The Last Few Weeks I’ve decided to do something slightly different with this entry. Today is July 8th, 2024 and I am currently sitting in an airport waiting for my first flight to Sydney from Melbourne. I am flying out for a non production build trip with our Australian customer New South Wales and hope to have a productive three and a half days in their offices setting up Epic for the first time for them. Given I have an hour and a half flight ahead of me, I’ll hand write this entry and upload the photos of the pages. Hopefully my handwriting is legible.\nTranscribed from notes in my notebook: I’ve realized a while ago that it was inevitable for me to eventually fall back into old habits and leisurely activities that I was used to back living alone in Wisconsin. There is only so much hiking and walking and exploring that one person can handle without feeling like it is an extra job to be enjoying your hobbies. A few weeks ago I went on two hikes back to back days … one on Saturday and one on Sunday. In reality, I was committing all of my time to those hiking days. As I was cat-sitting for a coworker at the same time, I was waking up at 4:00 AM to have time to walk to their apartment and feed the cat, so that I could then take a bus/tram/train to a separate location to meet up to hike at 7:00 AM. Then, following the hikes I would have to do the same walk back to feed the cat and get back home. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for previously cooking dinner and preparing sandwiches for lunch, I would have likely been too tired to eat dinner those days.\nWith that being said, my last few weeks were filed with watching movies, shows, and playing some video games that I’ve had on my backlog. In the last three weeks I’ve put a sizable dent in some shows that were on my watchlist. I finished and thoroughly enjoyed the ending to Dark Matter\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; playing on Apple TV+. I am watching “Presumed Innocent” as it releases each Wednesday. I am almost done with “The Pacific” which had an episode take place in Melbourne, which was a pleasant surprise. I watched “The Fall of the House of Usher” while doing things like filling out the paperwork for my passport renewal forms, comparing my finances, and doing dishes and laundry. I also watched “Inside Out 2”.\nLast week, I was finally reimbursed for some of the moving expenses I incurred during my relocation and so I took the chance to fill my emergency fund back up to close to where it was before. Almost everything was reimbursed that I logged, with only my computer purchase outstanding. It seems that Epic won’t pay for that, so I am happy that I was around net-even from the sale of my US computer to fund the purchase of the one here in Australia.\naside: Even on an hour and a half long flight, Qantas airlines provided pumpkin and carrot fritters that are warm and a great treat, especially for a 7:00 AM flight. I doubt any airline in the US would do that for a short domestic flight\nWith interest rates for my high yield savings account through Apple Savings at 4.4% and me maxing out my 401K and Roth IRA contributions every year since joining Epic, I am very happy with where I am financially. With the way I usually spend, I find myself in a situation where I want to make the most of my time out here with memorable trips. Currently, I’m really interested in trying to do some international hiking trips, with the only thing stopping me is the lack of confidence I have in my skills in multi-day trekking and the uncertainty of what I will do with my vacation days, but I realized as I looked more closely into it that the second one isn’t as much of a problem as I thought it was before, as after two years at Epic your vacation days accumulation rate increases to 1.25 days/month. Planning around weekends and quite a few trips can be done with my vacation rate at this point.\nTherefore, I want to get it in writing, but my current goals are to rent out a car and do two weekend day trips. One, to Philip Island and the nearby George Bass Coastal Walk. Two, for an overnight camping trip to Wilson’s Prom. I am giving myself until the end of August to do both. To do so I’ll need to figure out rental cars here in Australia and also buy some hiking gear like a tent, sleeping bag, and learn the logistics of food and water for a longer stay out in the wild.\nBeyond TV shows and movies, I also got back into video games that I haven’t played for a while because of the move. Back in February, I bought myself a bunch of singe player games that were story-rich. It took over a month, but I found the time to beat Final Fantasy VII Remake, and it’s prequel Crisis Core. Now I can’t wait for the PS5 exclusion Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth to release on the PC. I also got back in touch with friends from New Jersey and had a really long and fun gaming session playing a puzzle game called “Lorelei and the Laser Eyes” and we got o hoked that we beat the 15 hour game in two sessions and I may or may not have slept for one of those nights ;). I’m looking forward to continue to play through my backlog, with Hades as the next one on the list. The Alters also looks promising from it’s demo, which I played and recorded to put onto my youtube channel:\nFinally, our team here in Mebourne had our annual Epic Picnic “EpicNic” which we rebranded as “EpicVic” here in Australia as we are in the Victoria territory here. I included some pictures that I took, but it was more hectic than I would have liked. We were out in the Melbourne Zoo, and we had an event to go and find hidden clues around different paths around the zoo enclosures, but it ended up being that we were rushing through the locations instead of enjoying the animals. After the event was over I took some extra time to check out the Australia specific enclosures. If you had not heard of it before, I recommend you google what a cassowary is, as it was a very unique bird that I was able to see in its habitat that I didn’t know existed until that day. With that, I found that I’ve been writing for over an hour and we are about to land. Thank you for keeping me company throughout this flight.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"The Last Few Weeks It’s been a while since I last wrote one of these because the last few weeks have been busy with work and weekends of hiking. I’ve enjoyed walking around, especially at night to see the nooks and crannies of Melbourne. There’s a lot of hidden art around the neighborhood and the alleyways are always calling me to take the scenic route back when walking.\nEarlier in June I went and had some lunch and met with some local hires from Australia who made it back from the States to Melbourne after their training. I also spent a weekend cat sitting for a coworker and walked back and forth from my apartment to theirs for an hour. That same weekend was full of walking as I also spent time going on hikes out in the Werribee Gorge and the Cathedral Ranges. So far, these two hikes have been my favorite so far. The Gorge walk was with large scaled walls on both sides and more visual than some of the other hikes and walks that were done.\nI’ve definitely cemented that I want to find my way over to Tasmania to do some multi-day hikes because I find that I’ve been enjoying this type of lifestyle of non-stop walking and exploration. Even when I’m soaked and walking for multiple hours, I’m always smiling from ear to ear, so I want to pursue this hobby and interest even further and spend some more money towards it.\nAt the end of April I also got my Australian driver’s license and was put on a P2 (Probationary 2) driver’s license up until July 26th 2025, so I want to do as much as I can without a car until that date and then try some longer drives in both Australia and New Zealand after that date.\nImages and Videos Images Here Fun Songs "},{

  "content":"The Last Few Weeks I spent a lot of my time this week focused on work and trying to get in some good outdoor nature hikes and walks from the area. With Brian back in the office following his time in the US for XGM, Singapore has not calmed down with the amount of work that they require devoted to them. I find that there’s something extremely difficult with working on a customer that they themselves feel overwhelmed while also being generally new. Sometimes there’s a need to devote additional time to topics that make a good foundation of knowledge for their jobs, but then you realize you don’t have the time to be able to do it as you’re off solving another problem that pops up an hour later. I will say, that Singapore and I expect New South Wales will both keep me honest about whether I can actually explain the core concepts and how things in our Epic system interact with each other. Brian brings a lot of the technical knowledge that 10+ years of working has provided him, but I think I can help keep Brian and the ODBAs organized and aligned. I am a bit scared with how things will work once New South Wales work starts ramping up, but I am just hoping that we can get through some of the backlog that the RHEL8 migration brought with it.\nThe interesting thing about working with the customers out here in Australia, is there seem to be a lot of plans for expansion of the system, unless I just came at the time that a lot of our hardware configuration and parallel capacity assessment refreshes were happening. Each of the customers may be moving towards a future in the next two years where we need to buy new hardware. Specifically, Singapore and New South Wales are on a trajectory to being two of the biggest customers we have, and so I want to make myself a strong leader to my ODBAs and customer counterparts with making things feel like they are planned and completed in a smooth way, versus the more hectic approach that has been happening so far.\nIn a typical week so far, I have been averaging around 25 hours (consistently) devoted to working with Singapore.\nBeyond work, I have been forcing myself to be more of a self-sustaining adult. I have been cooking and bringing my own lunch to work every day, and while it feels like a lot of my time has been just staying up with cooking and cleaning and laundry and writing these journals, I think that they are all good habits to build. I wrote in the last entry that I was looking to meet with the Melbourne Bushwalking group, but I never found the time in the last two weeks to go downtown after work and meet with them. Instead, I met a group that meets and hikes every weekend and I ended up doing a 24km day of hiking with them recently. I took a few pictures and videos I uploaded to youtube above from the experience. It was also the first time I talked with some locals and they had some good interesting stories. One of the guys I met works for a smaller company that deals with geospatial data and worked on the map that you can get from scanning the QR codes at the local zoo. He also recommended I watch The Castle, as it’s a comedy set in Melbourne. I’m planning to try to get a movie night set up with some coworkers to do so. I also walked to the nearby Yarra River and took a pit stop at an ikea to buy some small house stuff like a mat for the bathroom.\nIn the last two weeks I’ve also spent some time watching some new shows and movies as well as playing a few games on my computer. I finished watching Sugar and thought it was just alright. The Fallout show was also enjoyable, but didn’t catch my intrigue as much as it might have someone who had played the games. It was definitely fun, but wasn’t as thought provoking or different than a lot of the things put out. I did really enjoy two shows throughout this week though. Ripley, released on Apple TV+ was a very interesting noir old-school Italian atmosphere around someone who commits identity theft and I think visually and story wise it grasped my attention quite well. I’ve also been enjoying Dark Matter on Apple TV+ which has scratched my itch of the type of overthinking mind-bending shows that I always like to ponder. If you like Inception, Dark, or Interstellar, you’d probably like Dark Matter. Finally, I also watched the 2024 released movie Civil War, which was an interesting take on the subject. I didn’t expect the movie to follow a photographer through a make-believe rendition of a civil war, but it at least kept my attention while I cooked and cleaned one evening.\nI had also found out these last two weeks that my favorite musical artist released an album that I missed while preparing for the trip to Australia and so I enjoyed listening to Finest on loop throughout this week.\nThis upcoming weekend I’m going to be going to Lerderdeng Gorge for a hike with someone that reached out on Facebook. On Sunday I’ll try to go to a museum as I haven’t been yet, and I’m also going to head to a coworkers place as I’ve agreed to cat sit for them over the long King’s weekend on June 8th. I’ll probably read a bit more of my book with some of that downtime of traveling. I have a few books on my backlog, including wanting to read the book that Dark Matter was based on as it seems very intriguing.\nI’m also going to make some commitments for long term Australia plans here in writing so I can see whether I can stick to them. I want to travel out to New Zealand for a few days. I want to meet one of my old coworkers when I interned there back in 2019 and then also go and do a few things I didn’t have a chance to do before due to money or time. I want to get comfortable with overnight hiking and I want to plan to do one or two long term treks in Tasmania. I think I can have a great time by committing ~$2k for the equipment and then the plane ticket and accommodation. I want to explore Singapore in October when I go out for a DR cutover event with my customers. I want to try to maybe tack on some vacation time afterwards to see some of Vietnam/Thailand/Indonesia, but I don’t know how plausible that is as I expect there will be issues following the event that we will be trying to solve the following week. I want to get comfortable with renting out a car in Australia and doing some longer weekend drives. Sometimes I feel like I may enjoy just driving and seeing the countryside without having a specific destination in mind, but I can likely find some great destinations and make some fun road trips.

  "content":"Introduction Compared to my first two weeks in Australia, the last two weeks have been a lot calmer. I decided to take it slow this week as I’ve been backing up one of my colleagues\u0026rsquo; customers as they flew out for Epic’s XGM conference back in Wisconsin and so I was the front-line Server Systems person available for three customers for the last week and a few days the week before. I got myself accustomed to going to the grocery store after work before arriving back home to make it an easier walk and I had another big day of cleaning as a few kitchen supplies came in to help me with meal-prepping.\nWeekend Activities Saturday, April 27th was quite an eventful day as it started with me having to go downtime to pick up a keyboard for my newly bought computer. The girl I bought it from lived downtime in the QV Melbourne which was this big shopping center where I guess the third and fourth floors were reserved for actual residents. There was a food court on the ground floor, some shops for the next two floors and then elevator access to things like laundry and gyms and the apartments themselves. It was a nice atmosphere, but I very much expect the prices to be absurd to rent over there. Afterwards, I decided to take a walk down to the river and the royal botanical gardens, which were quite pleasant as it was a nice sunny and warm day. On my way back home, I passed near the sports centers and actually ended up near the arena at the time people were rushing in to get to a game. Huge crowds and everyone wearing their teams colors. Australians take their sports seriously it seems.\nOn Sunday, I took a walk to explore one of the smaller libraries near my apartment, but didn’t find anything I liked. It was a small and quiet building, but I’ll likely try to find some time to head down to the big popular one downtown on an upcoming weekend.\nI’ve started watching a few shows recently now that my computer and TV are set up how I’m used to. I’ve really enjoyed the release of “Dark Matter” on Apple TV and it’s two episodes so far. I was also able to finish watching “Barry” during the weekdays and kept up to date with “X-men ‘97” and “Sugar” which have been releasing on Thursdays.\nSaturday, May 11th, I met up with some coworkers and took a bus down to St. Kilda to play volleyball on the beach. It was a very nice atmosphere and yet another warm and sunny day. I know that my legs will be aching for a while from all the tournament games we played, but it turns out that the season just ended and they hosted this one off event on a Saturday because the weather was nice. I will definitely be joining when the season restarts later in October.\nI had been looking to find good ways to meet some locals and did some research online for a few things I was interested in going to, but didn’t have a chance to these last two weeks as I stayed at work a bit later than I needed to in order to make those timings. The one I am most interested in is a bushwalking club that meets downtown and goes out to some hikes and trails around the Melbourne area. They all pitch together to get cars or buses to the start and end of the trails and make a half-day event out of them on Sundays. Seems fun and I’m hoping to introduce myself on Wednesday!\nhttps://mbw.org.au/mbw_index.php\nI also plan to consolidate grocery expenses out here into a spreadsheet for myself to compare with how much things cost back home. It’s been really hard to ground myself with prices for food as there’s a conversion for AUD to USD, but also a unit conversion of lbs to kg or to 100g as a baseline. I don’t think I’ve yet overpaid absurdly for any groceries, but there are some things that I just don’t know if they’re much more expensive than in the US at this point, or if the prices are generally comparable.\nImages and Videos Images Here "},{

  "content":"When I was moving out of my apartment in Wisconsin, I realized how helpful and important it was to look back at the prices that I purchased things and to help wrap my head around how much money it will take to move to a new apartment and furnish it all from the beginning. I expect this will be a good exercise for me to organize a bunch of my own purchases to try to get some things reimbursed from the trip, but the following is all the money I have spent alongside the move. Maybe I can optimize this next time around! This does not include recurring expenses like food or transportation that needed to be purchased irrelevant of a move.\nThe money I re-couped from my move:\nSold my TV for $150 Sold my couch and some end tables for $250 Sold exercise bench and dumbbells for $120 Sold my computer for $700 Kept some furniture and moved it back to New Jersey, so there are less things to purchase on the way back.

  "content":"Introduction Back in my sophomore year of college, I had the opportunity to go to Chengdu, China on an internship program. During my time there, I had a job, but was also taking some classes for credit and one of the classes stressed the value of writing a weekly journal during my time abroad as a way to process and put into words the new experiences I was going through at the time. I personally think that one of the most important things you can do in your life is learn from your past experiences and find the things that you enjoy. There’s been plenty of times that I have gone for walks around town back in Wisconsin and New Jersey where I would take a picture of a house and jot down a reason why I liked a certain part of it or a new perspective on how things are run in different countries. I want to be able to write a journal for my thoughts, not just to keep people in the loop back home about how things are going out in Australia, but also as a way for me to remember the adventures and struggles of this part in my life twenty or more years down the road. I want to write about the ways I have done things, things that I like and don’t like, and getting into the weeds of things like finances and planning trips to go see different places and just move my thoughts from my brain to a digital media. I also want to share pictures! Now, with the introduction out of the way, here’s a few thoughts on the first few weeks before and arriving in Australia.\nI plan to write one of these every two weeks or so, as I think that’s more sustainable for the long run of three years.\nGetting Things Ready Through most of March and April (and honestly ever since like January) I spent a lot of time getting things ready for getting out of my apartment in Wisconsin, getting all my bills and services canceled, and getting furniture sold. It felt a bit disappointing that there were things that I had spent two years getting to make my space my own having to be sold for usually less than I paid for. Still, I think I enjoy decorating my living space as the constraints of the floorplan and furniture lets my mind think of all these cool different configurations for where to place things and how to make a space uniquely mine that I was looking forward to seeing what I could do with my space in Australia. I also spent some time exploring a few other places I hadn’t been yet in Wisconsin. I wanted to go see Taliesin and House on the Rock, but unfortunately those places were closed until around mid-April. Ultimately, I think I did good in the things I sold off (a couch to a girl that was moving into a new apartment on the east side of town, and some exercise equipment to a mother with some rowdy boys probably going to college soon) but I very much appreciate one of my uncles back from Connecticut who was used to doing long haul drives making his way over with a trailer attachment and helping me load things back to New Jersey. On April 5th, I got a phone call early on my drive to work that my uncle was going to be entering Wisconsin at around noon, so I pivoted to taking a half and half day and made time for some goodbyes around the office. I was also lucky enough to have lunch with one of my ODBAs, Meenoi, who was at the campus for some training so we spent some time chatting. I left work around 1 PM and drove back home and started to pack a few items into the back of my car before my uncle arrived and we put the larger furniture items into his. It was a lot of work, but we got everything ready for the drive by around 5-6 PM.\nThe Drive Afterwards, I had a 17 hour drive ahead of me back to New Jersey. Previously in the week, I was messing around with Cruise Control around some highways and parking lots to get comfortable with my car’s use of it. I had only ever driven 3 hours straight for a trip out to Door County back in September, so I wasn’t really aware how I would feel. My uncle and I parted ways and took our own pace to get back to New Jersey. My first stop was to fill up at a gas station and to buy myself a Monster Energy drink for the road, as my coworker Elisha mentioned that it was what I needed for the long road ahead. I noticed an “Aussie Lemonade” flavor which felt like destiny so I went with that. Then, I got onto the BeltLine highway and was greeted with the absolute worst traffic I’ve experienced in Wisconsin throughout all my time there. Supposedly there was a pretty big accident and so I spent more time getting out of Madison than afterwards taking the highway from Madison to Milwaukee. Lovely. The rest of the drive was pretty smooth sailing. I cooked some kielbasa and cut it up into slices and ate it like beef jerky throughout my drive, and was able to get through Chicago and a part of Illinois without taking a break. I took my first 30 minute break or so in Portage. I kept driving through Indiana, Ohio and the western part of Pennsylvania throughout the night, taking a stop here or there to fill up gas and/or stretch my legs and I cracked my Monster Energy drink around midnight and had a pretty great stretch of driving from midnight to around 4:30 AM where there were no cars and good tunes. Around 4 AM I thought to drive by a rest stop to try and get some sleep as I started to feel the effects of not being able to focus on the road. It wasn’t too bad, but I knew it would probably get worse. Unfortunately, while I had a pillow and blanket ready and the rest area was pretty good, I wasn’t able to get too much sleep. I closed my eyes for a while, but woke up and realized only 40 minutes had passed, and just knew this wasn’t going to work. Some louder trucks were nearby and I just couldn’t get comfortable. Around 6, I started driving again to finish the final stretch through Pennsylvania and it wasn’t the best until like 9 AM. It got a lot better after I stopped by a McDonalds and got a coffee and some breakfast, but I don’t care to remember those hours. I arrived back in New Jersey around noon and got home around 1 PM on Saturday April 6th after around 1,000 miles of driving. I enjoyed a few days with hometown friends and family and did some final work before my flight out on April 11th (Thursday of the following week).\nOverall, with less than a year of driving under my belt, I feel like I could make my way anywhere at this point, which I personally think was a big accomplishment for me. Maybe I will drive out to Mt. Rushmore next time I’m out in Wisconsin, haha.\nOther I also included some videos of a real estate agent out in Melbourne doing inspections of some properties. I didn’t get the first one I applied for, but paid slightly extra for the second one to make sure I, for sure, had a place to live once my hotel ended. It was priced at $560 AUD a week, or around $1,750 USD a month. I was paying $1,050 a month in Wisconsin for a bigger place, but I guess I won’t be paying transportation costs and will be able to walk to the grocery store, work, and train stations for when I want to travel a bit further.\nImages and Videos Images Here "},{

  "content":"I left for the airport on April 11th to leave the US and start the next big adventure of my life. I still don’t think I’ll ever understand how much time I need at Newark. Some days, like today, I was able to get through customs in around 30 minutes. Other times, I need over an hour and there’s no rhyme or reason to understanding what kind of day it will be. I downloaded a few TV shows and movies and got a few books ready on my phone for the journey. Dune Two was alright, but I didn’t fully get the hype. I would say it was slightly better than Dune One, but it’s mainly a story about the world and politics of the world, instead of the characters that inhabit it, which I more often prefer. Kung Fu Panda 4 was passable, but nothing special. I was also planning to watch Pan’s Labyrinth, but I got a Spanish version so I quickly went away from that one. With a 6 hour layover in San Francisco, I spent some time listening to some music and just waiting for the time to pass. I read a bunch of “Wiser, Richer, Happier” by William Green and enjoyed the break out of each chapter being about a different person so I could put it down and find something else when I wasn’t feeling it. I had a middle seat on the 15 hour flight to Australia and I got some sleep in, but I tried to convert it over to Australian time for when I should be sleeping.\nThe first week went by pretty fast. After landing, on the first day I walked around a bit to get used to the city. I lugged my two large suitcases, one carry-on suitcase and one backpack 30 minutes or so to the hotel. I probably should have figured out a bus or something, but I’m a cheapskate and didn’t want to deal with figuring it out. The hotel room was like a full apartment, with a full kitchen and living room for around the price you would get a US hotel for, so if these compare to others in Australia, hotels are probably better value here. The rest of the first day was spent going to a grocery store to get a few items for lunch and dinner, and then getting my phone set up with Optus. I also took a walk to see my new apartment complex in person, met the building manager and made sure that nothing was missed in terms of paperwork or planning while I was still in the US. I tried to set up my bank as well, but it was closed over the weekend.\nDay two, I made a larger grocery store trip to an Aldi that wasn’t too far away, but was going to be the one I was using long term as it was close to my work and I also checked out our office lobby and surrounding area. I spent a lot of the rest of the day searching on Facebook marketplace for furniture and ordering a mattress and bed frame for when I would eventually get my apartment on Friday that following week. I walked around to some other areas around the city as well. I personally enjoy opening up my google maps app and finding a green area, be it a park or bike trail or section near a river and just finding my way over there, so I did something similar and explored a few parks as well as some other places where I was possibly looking to get an apartment at to just explore parts of the city.\nOn Monday, I woke up at 4 AM due to jet lag and made some lunch for work early that morning. On my way to work I saw a hot air balloon (I would see more on Friday from my hotel balcony) which felt like a good sign for a great new beginning. It wasn’t a Ho-Oh at the start of Ash’s Pokemon journey, but I’ll take what I can get haha. Work was pretty slow as I was getting myself situated, but a lot of the folks that I spoke to so far weren’t actually in the office that day. My move mentor Houston was out, my team lead Cory was out, and my coworker Brian was out. I decided to take a few hours of out of office time to finish setting up my bank and I also needed to walk over to my apartment because for once, Amazon shipping was too fast and I needed to tell them to try to redeliver on Friday as I didn’t have access yet, but the folks doing the deliver where understanding and friendly. After work throughout the week I spent my time scouring Facebook marketplace for more furniture pieces (I was able to find a couch for $420 AUS) and watched some 3 Body Problem on Netflix.\nThe rest of the week flew by as I learned about all the Australian and Singapore customers at work and prepped for my move on Friday. Friday morning I left for work early so I could take my smaller carry-on suitcase and some bags over to pick up my keys. I wasn’t expecting to be woken up by a fire alarm at 1 AM on Friday though, which made the rest of that day really long. Anyway… I was pleasantly surprised that my apartment came with a fridge and washing machine as I wasn’t initially expecting that it would. Between work I also left to help move the couch I purchased into the apartment at around 1 PM that day and some other furniture that was arriving throughout the day. Once work was over, I walked back to my hotel and packed up my other two suitcases and walked them over 30 minutes to the new apartment. My hotel was ending on Saturday morning so I decided it was likely better to walk them over in the evening when there was less traffic than during a Saturday morning. I also spent more time at the apartment that night to open up my mattress-in-a-box to let it inflate and be ready for use the next night. Then I walked back to my apartment and crashed for the night, at around 1 AM.\nSaturday morning I woke up around 7 AM and headed down to the lobby to check out. I spent most of Saturday building my bed from the Amazon packages and cooked a few meals for the weekend. I did inspect the apartment and took pictures for the inspection report that I needed to fill out. Sometime in the afternoon I decided to take another walk this time to the other side of town where I was at to see the Edinburgh Gardens (which is not actually any gardens but just a public park). It was a nice day and a worthy walk. I also found a guy who was selling some plants on Facebook marketplace so I decided to walk over and buy 4 for $30 AUS (or $20 USD), and it made my apartment feel a bit more homey. That night I was also able to find a lady on Facebook Marketplace who flipped storage lockers by buying them at an auction and then selling what they held for a profit, and she had some desks for sale. A big plus was she was fine with delivering, even though she lived an hour away, because she did this pretty much for a living. We went back and forth a bit and I decided it made more sense for me to take a trip out to her by train to see what other things I might be interested in to get a big bulk buy. We landed on me arriving at 4 PM on Sunday because she had some other deliveries to make earlier that day.\nI decided on Sunday that I would make a bigger trip out of my train ride up to South Murang, as I saw that there was a nice park (Plenty Gorge Park) which had kangaroos just hanging out in the wild over there. I cooked some chicken and a salad for lunch and decided to leave around noon for the train ride. I really enjoyed the houses around the area, and it was a lot more suburban than the inner city of Collingwood. After speaking to the lady, I learned that her rent for her entire 4 bedroom house there was the same as my one bedroom apartment ($560 AUS a week or $1700 USD a month) which made me get a little bit more hope in the country as a whole because I am definitely over paying for what I am getting here, but you have to deal with the cards you are dealt and I’d rather be walking distance from the place where I work than pay $3 USD each way every day to commute by tram. The train ticket was also $3 USD for a one-hour ride, so I’ll definitely be using it whenever I can to explore the surrounding areas near Melbourne. When I arrived at South Murang, I spent a few hours walking around Plenty Gorge Park and was able to see some kangaroos in person as well as quite a few varieties of what we would deem as exotic birds (colorful parrots, herons, etc.) during my walk. I then met with the lady and got a bunch of kitchen supplies, a broom, a vacuum, an ironing board, some pots for my newly purchased plants, two tables, two comfortable office chairs (that don’t swivel) and one office desk chair that does for $350 AUS (or $230 USD). Quite a good deal if you ask me. The rest of that day I spent cleaning parts of the apartment and the new items I got. Near the end of the day I found someone on Facebook marketplace again that was selling his computer so I walked not too far over to check it out in person and introduce myself. Crazy coincidence that he would be moving out to the States (Long Island, NY) in a month while I just moved here, so we kind of swapped places. He would later help move the computer, along with two monitors on Thursday, which was a national holiday, Anzac Day.\nThe rest of the following week went by without too many interesting things happening. It mainly pertained to me coming in to work, and after work coming back and cleaning more of the items I got. My physical bank card came in the mail earlier that week so I got to use that without having to get hit by foreign transaction fees each time I took money out of the ATM to buy some other cleaning supplies, groceries, and household essentials (toilet paper, cutting board, tea :))\nToday is Saturday morning. I plan to make a trip down to the CBD, aka the downtown part of Melbourne, to pick up a keyboard and mouse that I’m purchasing (again from Facebook Marketplace) and am going to spend some time walking around the Yarra River that flows through the city. There are a few botanical gardens nearby and I think a nice day is ahead of me. I got a new phone before my trip out here and unfortunately location services with google weren’t set correctly to show different trips and paths that I’ve walked around the city, but I’ve corrected that this morning and hope to add some cool maps and routes to future entries. I’ve done that before with my travels around the world and would recommend it if you ever find yourself abroad.\nSome things I’ve noticed as pros and cons around Melbourne throughout my first few weeks here:\nPro: Playgrounds and public spaces look a lot more funded.\nPro: There are plenty of exotic and noisy birds that make walking and just looking around fun.\nPro: A lot more things are open outdoor concepts. Restaurants and buildings are built around opening up to the outdoors and having plenty of outdoor seating areas. Some cafes are literally garages where the garage door is open and then it’s decorated like a living space within.\nCon: The pedestrian crossing sign only shows you when you can cross if you press the button.\nCon: There are a bunch of cafes and lunch spaces, but I’m not fully interested in spending $700 a month on eating out to explore them. I’ll probably just cook more often.\nImages + Videos Images Here "}]
